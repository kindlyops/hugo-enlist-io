questions:
  - question: What's an active job?
  -  answer: An active job is a job that you are actively hiring for. A single active job can have multiple openings. Once you've filled an opening, you can pause the job, and you won't be charged for it.
  - question: Is there a limit on the number of candidates I can add?
  -  answer: None — you can add as many candidates as you would like.
  - question: How many team members can I add?
  - answer: As many as you want! enlist doesn't put a limit on the number of team members you can invite to your account.
  - question: Can I pause my subscription and resume later?
  - answer: Yes! You can pause your subscription and resume anytime you want. All your data is kept safe and secure—you can pick up from where you paused.
  - question: Is enlist GDPR compliant?
  - answer: Yes! We have self-certified to the Privacy Shield. You can review our GDPR compliance here. In addition, enlist has all the tools you need to be GDPR compliant as a controller.
