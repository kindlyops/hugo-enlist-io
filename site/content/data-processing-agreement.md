During the term of this DPA, the Processor shall provide the Controller with at least 14 days prior notification, via email (or in-application notice), of any changes to the list of Sub-processor(s) who may process Personal Data before authorising any new or replacement Sub-processor(s) to process Personal Data in connection with the provision of the Services.

If the Controller objects to a new or replacement Sub-processor the Controller may terminate the Terms of Use with respect to those Services which cannot be provided by the Processor without the use of the new or replacement Sub-processor.

The limitations on liability set out in the Terms of Use apply to all claims made pursuant to any breach of the terms of this DPA.

The parties agree that the Processor shall be liable for any breaches of this DPA caused by the acts and omissions or negligence of its Sub-processors to the same extent the Processor would be liable if performing the services of each Sub-processor directly under the terms of the DPA, subject to any limitations on liability set out in the terms of the Terms of Use.

The parties agree that the Controller shall be liable for any breaches of this DPA caused by the acts and omissions or negligence of its Subsidiaries as if such acts, omissions or negligence had been committed by the Controller itself.

The Controller shall not be entitled to recover more than once in respect of the same claim.

#### 8. Audit
The Processor shall make available to the Controller all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with its processing obligations and allow for and contribute to audits and inspections.

Any audit conducted under this DPA shall consist of examination of the most recent reports, certificates and/or extracts prepared by an independent auditor bound by confidentiality provisions similar to those set out in the Agreement. In the event that provision of the same is not deemed sufficient in the reasonable opinion of the Controller, the Controller may at its own expense conduct a more extensive audit which will be:

(i) limited in scope to matters specific to the Controller and agreed in advance with the Processor;

(ii) carried out during US business hours and upon reasonable notice which shall be not less than 4 weeks unless an identifiable material issue has arisen; and

(iii) conducted in a way which does not interfere with the Processor’s day-to-day business.

This clause shall not modify or limit the rights of audit of the Controller, instead it is intended to clarify the procedures in respect of any audit undertaken pursuant thereto.

#### 9. Data Deletion
The Controller will enable the Processor to delete Personal Data using the functionality provided by the Service. After a period of 14 days, the Processor will permanently delete the Personal Data from the live systems.

On termination, the Controller has the option to request the return or deletion of Personal Data. This request must be made within 14 days of termination. The Processor will make the data available for download by the Controller in a machine readable format. Thereafter the Processor will permanently delete the Personal Data from the live systems in any event.

Following permanent deletion from the live systems, partial data resides on the Processor’s archival systems for a period of up to 30 days. If requested by the Controller, the Processor may be able to assist with recovery of partial data from these archives during this period. A fee will be charged for this service.

#### 10. Notification of Data Breach
The Processor shall notify the Controller without undue delay after becoming aware of (and in any event within 72 hours of discovering) any accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorised disclosure or access to any Personal Data (“Data Breach”).

The Processor will take all commercially reasonable measures to secure the Personal Data, to limit the effects of any Data Breach and to assist the Controller in meeting the Controller’s obligations under applicable law.

The Processor’s notification of, or response to, a Data Breach under this Section 10 will not be construed as an acknowledgement by the Processor of any fault or liability with respect to the Data Breach.

The Processor will not assess the content of the Controller’s data in order to identify information subject to any specific Controller data breach. Controller is solely responsible for complying with data breach notification laws applicable to the Controller and fulfilling any third party notification obligations related to any Data Breach(es).

#### 11. Compliance, Cooperation and Response
In the event that the Processor receives a request from a Data Subject in relation to Personal Data, the Processor will refer the Data Subject to the Controller unless otherwise prohibited by law. The Controller shall reimburse the Processor for all costs incurred resulting from providing reasonable assistance in dealing with a Data Subject request or assisting the Controller in complying with its duties. In the event that the Processor is legally required to respond to the Data Subject, the Controller will fully cooperate with the Processor as applicable.

The Processor will notify the Controller promptly of any request or complaint regarding the processing of Personal Data, which adversely impacts the Controller, unless such notification is not permitted under applicable law or a relevant court order.

The Processor may make copies of and/or retain Personal Data in order to comply with its legal or regulatory requirement including, but not limited to, retention requirements.

The parties acknowledge that it is the duty of the Controller to notify the Processor within a reasonable time, of any changes to applicable data protection laws, codes or regulations which may affect the contractual duties of the Processor. The Processor shall respond within a reasonable timeframe in respect of any changes that need to be made to the terms of this DPA or to the technical and organisational measures to maintain compliance. If the parties agree that amendments are required, but the Processor is unable to accommodate the necessary changes, the Controller may terminate the part or parts of the Services which give rise to the non-compliance. To the extent that other parts of the Services provided are not affected by such changes, the provision of those Services shall remain unaffected.

The Controller and the Processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on request, with a supervisory data protection authority in the performance of their respective obligations under this DPA.

The parties agree that the Processor will be entitled to charge the Controller additional fees to reimburse the Processor for its staff time, costs and expenses in assisting the Controller, when the Controller requests the Processor to provide assistance pursuant to this DPA. In such cases, the Processor will notify the Controller of its fees for providing assistance, in advance.

#### 13. General
This DPA sets out the entire understanding of the parties with regards to the subject matter herein.

Should a provision of this DPA be invalid or become invalid then the legal effect of the other provisions shall be unaffected. A valid provision is deemed to have been agreed which comes closest to what the parties intended commercially and shall replace the invalid provision. The same shall apply to any omissions.
