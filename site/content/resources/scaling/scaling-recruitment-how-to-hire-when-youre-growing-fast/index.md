You are probably running into all kinds of stumbling blocks as you scale your company. Hiring at scale is entirely different from hiring at the start. In your quest for speed, you can easily end up bringing people who don't quite fit in your company. Poor hires, as you already know, are costly, and poor hiring at this stage of a company can break it.

  Let's look at some of the things that can help you when scaling your company.
#### Know who you are hiring

One of the most difficult problems at scale is communication. You have different people who need to know exactly what you are looking for, the job requirements, and how they are supposed to go about hiring them.

It's important, then, to write down the job requirements, description, and responsibilities in a clear and concise manner. It's even more important to ensure everyone who is going to be involved in the hiring process has easy access to that information.

#### Structure

Beyond a point, you need to structure your hiring and you need a dedicated team of recruiters who can source, interview, and onboard candidates. You cannot manage all your hiring yourself, like you probably used to earlier.

One of the easiest things to improve upon is your interview process. Often, with companies growing fast, the interview process isn't structured and repeatable. It's different for everyone. That is a waste of time and it doesn't get you the right results.

Divide your job pipeline into stages in a way that each stage gives you some additional information about the candidate. For example, you could a process that consists of a screening step, then a phone interview, then a couple of interviews onsite with your team. At every stage, you get to know a little more about the candidate and their capabilities.

Every job will have a different process but you must make sure that anyone applying for—or hiring for—a job doesn't go through several different processes. Consistency and repeatability are the keys to scaling your hiring.

#### Automate

Every hiring process has a lot of grunt work that could easily be automated. Think about the thank you e-mails you send to candidates, the interview schedule requests, the review requests to your interviewers... all those are steps that are better automated.

More advanced [hiring software](/) will allow to you create workflows that can automate parts of your hiring. Adopting such a software when you're hiring at scale is a good idea.

It's important, however, to not take automation to its extremes. It's generally a bad idea to reject applications based on certain triggers. Unless you absolutely cannot work without a certain credential or a certain requirement, it is better to screen people manually even if it takes a bit more time.

#### Track everything

As you grow, it's all the more important to look for inefficient parts of your hiring workflows. What sources aren't working? Which job boards give you the best candidates? Which recruiters refer the most skilled people? Being able to answer these questions will help you scale better.

Yet again, this is an area that you can automate through software. You don't need to manage huge excel sheets containing every last bit of data. That's not only inefficient but also unnecessary. Modern ATSes can help you track every important piece of data and give you insights that help you improve your hiring.

#### Onboarding

At scale, even onboarding new team members can be difficult. By the time they have spent a week, there are ten new faces. Their first day can be daunting too. Your team is already busy... who has got the time to help a new candidate onboard?

It's another thing where a well-defined process can help. It's not too difficult, even for a fast growing company, to take a few minutes to welcome a new team member. At the very least, the team that the person is joining should know about him. The first week goes a long way in helping a new team member feel a part of the team.

Onboarding is also a lot about taking care of the little things like the right setup, creating all the necessary accounts, etc. It's even better if you can assign someone specific to help the candidate out for the first week.
