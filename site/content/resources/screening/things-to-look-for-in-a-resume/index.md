Finding the right person for any job is challenging. You publish a job, applications come in, you screen their resumes and move them on to the next stages. To make sure your pipeline has high quality candidates, you need to ensure your screening process is robust.
Evaluating a resume isn't as easy as it sounds. Especially for a small business, it is difficult to know what to look for in a resume. Let's look at some of the things that make a good resume.

#### Is it relevant?

An obvious thing, you would think. But you would be surprised at how many irrelevant resumes you get when you publish a job opening.

Allowing an open application for people who want to join your company but cannot find the right opening might be a good idea. It will cut down on irrelevant applications and you may just discover some great talent.

#### Is it concise?

A resume that spans three pages may look impressive, but often it just contains a lot of filler. A candidate should be able to demonstrate their capabilities and experience in a short, concise resume.

Now, this doesn't apply for every profession, everywhere. At times, you want candidates to describe their work in greater detail. That's fine; you just need to know when a long resume is a necessary and when it's not.

#### Is it littered with grammatical errors?

You would expect a candidate to take the time to edit their resume when they are applying for a job. I wouldn't mind the odd spelling mistake, but if the resume has a grammatical mistake every other sentence, maybe it's not a great application.

In any job — and even when you are hiring remote — communication is perhaps the most important skill. The resume (and the cover letter) is a peek into the candidate's writing capabilities. Take it seriously.

#### Is it a match?

Of course. A resume can be grammatically flawless, short and easy to read, and yet not a great match for the role you're hiring for. Don't feel bad about rejecting them. Just make sure you are courteous and communicate with the candidate.

So that's all. Screening resumes sounds easy but it can be a mentally taxing process. You're in an unusual position — of judging someone's skills and making a decision. With practice, it will get easier.
