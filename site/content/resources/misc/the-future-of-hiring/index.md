The future of work and the future of hiring for the next five years are changing right now. The average tenure of jobs in a company has gone down drastically.  Now on average an employee spends only [three years](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/how-long-should-an-employee-stay-at-a-job-2059796) at one organization.  Now is the time to start adapting your recruiting strategy for the future.  Defining the balance between the best candidate and the best use of resources will be one of the keys to recruiting success in the future of work.  Instead of looking for the best candidate, you should be looking for the best candidate for right now.

#### Hire for Right Now
Strategize with your hiring managers.  Hiring managers have been typically more concerned with defining who exactly they are looking for rather than why they are hiring.  They have been adamant about skills needed, education requirements, and where and what type of experience their “dream candidate” has but not concerned as much about the actual lifecycle of their employees.  Candidates will not be looking for an opportunity that will last them a lifetime. Hiring in the future will consist of hiring for right now.  You can work with hiring managers to first define the scope of work, then define the person they are looking for not the other way around.  The recruiter and the hiring manager need to come together and perhaps compromise on what they are looking for to keep it in the realm of possibilities.  Balancing potential candidate wants versus actual business needs should be part of this discussion.  Holding out for someone with a degree from a specific educational institution, should not be a part of that discussion.  The future workforce will be highly skilled however, this skill base and knowledge will not come from traditional institutions of education.  This skill base and knowledge will come from varied experience in multiple fields and with multiple organizations. The candidate of the future is looking for a good fit for right now, not a company to retire with. 

#### Lifestyle Compensation
One of the things that will be most important to future employees is flexibility.  Flexible work hours in conjunction with flexible work locations will make your employee value proposition stand neck and shoulders above any others.  Is there a real business need for work to be done at certain times and geographic locations? Or are those just fabrications of work culture of the past? Compared with flexibility in schedule and location,  things like salary and career development will be secondary.  This will become the new work-culture fit.  Flexibility will also apply to the duration of work.  Compressed work hours will be a huge part of compensation negotiation.  This will require a change in your hiring managers’ mentality to shift to a more outcome-based work environment rather than the current standard of pay for time.  The cost of hire will no longer be based on employee salary alone, it will include all aspects of the lifestyle you are able to offer your employees.
  
Employees of the future will want work that fits **their** lifestyle not the other way around.  They will be productive, innovative, and accountable in a completely different way than the traditional workforce of the past.  This will be the future of hiring.   How will you source, recruit, and hire this future workforce? How can you provide a work environment and compensation that can compete?
