 The workforce of the future will be fully remote.  Everyone working together but separate, successfully working on project after project while never actually being in the same office or even the same country.

This may sound counter-intuitive to team success however many studies have found that this way of working actually helps teams become more productive.  Without the endless meetings and the demands of inter-office social politics the remote team of today find that their relationships with their co-workers are based on more than just proximity, they are based on trust. Good and effective communication is the foundation of that trust.

#### Barriers to Communication
Space might seem like the biggest barrier to communication on any team, however you [may be surprised to learn](https://www.yodiz.com/blog/top-7-communication-barriers-at-workplace-benefits-of-effective-communication/) that the biggest barrier is lack of confidence.  Being a part of a fully remote team helps this barrier melt away.  Lack of confidence can grow inside any team member and is often multiplied by perception in body language, clothing, hygiene and many other factors that come to play while engaging in face to face interaction.  This begs the question, how can you have effective communication on your remote team and overcome traditional communication barriers?

#### Slack
Slack has quickly become the most relied on tool for communication for a successful fully remote team.  It has become an encrypted virtual water cooler where your team can communicate between each other.  Part chat application part email reducer, Slack gives your team the flexibility to communicate wherever they are in the world.  By using notifications and @mentions you can ping your team members on projects as well as create different channels for different needs.  Not working on a certain project?  No problem there is no need to be notified about it’s status.  Private channels also help your team to be able to communicate openly without being worried that someone may be looking in on their conversation.  This fosters a trust that leads to good communication.  You can also set working hours so you will automatically be logged on and notified of new communication, or you can silence all notifications and walk away when you are not available.

#### Whats App
But what about the small team or start up that is fully remote but doesn’t have the resources for an enterprise messaging application like Slack?  No problem!  Whats App fills this niche.  While offering end to end encryption in addition to read receipts many remote teams prefer the straight forward nature of Whats App.  If you can text you can use Whats App and unless members of your team are based in [China, North Korea, Cuba or the UAE](http://friendsoffortpointchannel.org/countries-where-whatsapp-is-banned/) you will all be able to have full functionality wherever your team members are based.

#### What is the Standard For Good Communication On a Fully Remote Team
While not every team is the same there is a universal benchmark.  Do you have trust between team members?  Do you have a team that is not afraid to put something out there without first worrying about what their co-workers will think?  If you can say yes to those questions then you have trust between you and your team members.  That is the foundation and gold standard for good communication.  

A fully remote team may not have some of the barriers that traditional teams have but that does not mean they inherently have trust between one another.  Good communication built on trust needs to be developed and cultivated.  Tools can help this process, but in the end it is up to each member of your team to foster the environment needed for good communication.  It may take some time, but the effort will reap huge dividends.
