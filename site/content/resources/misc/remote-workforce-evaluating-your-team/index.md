Are you responsible for a fully remote team?  What if your team is remote but you are based in the office, how can you properly evaluate your team members and be able to answer to those above you in the management chain?
For years these have been concerns that have kept employers from offering remote positions, however while the work environment may have changed some of those concerns remain the same.  Whether they are spoken or not, as a manager of a fully remote team you may be having a hard time evaluating your team members.  Determining areas of improvement, coaching, counseling and even disciplinary measures can be a formidable obstacle for a fully remote workforce.  Let’s consider some seemingly small steps you can take today that will have a huge impact on your success as you manage the new remote workforce.

#### Step One: Setting Clear Expectations
Setting clear expectations is something that employers and managers often think they have already done.  As a manager you may say to yourself, “ All the expectations were carefully added to the job description, also I worked with my employee for a whole week.  They should clearly know what is expected of them.”  While that may sound ridiculous, you would be surprised how common this sentiment is.  This type of sink or swim company culture is usually the opposite of the one the HRM has sold your employee.  This creates a conflict of expectations that lead to a poor evaluation of your team member and may even create a massive waste of time and money in employee churn.  How can you solve this problem?  Firstly, developing a competent onboarding and training process would be the best measure but that is often talked about and seldom acted on.  While you take the time to develop that program for your team, write down a clear set of expectations for each job.  

Ask yourself:

- What does my employee need to accomplish in a day?
- What do they need to accomplish in a month?
- What kind of tasks would this include?
- What are some of the challenges of this position?
- What are some things that should be easy?
- What does success in this position look like?
- What does failure look like?

You can add as many considerations to this list as you see appropriate, the idea is to have a list in the first place.  Write it down and think about these questions for each position on your remote team.  Clear expectations will most likely differ for each position.  Next, format these in an easy to read document and keep it in a safe place.  Keep it in Google Drive, [Notion.so](https://www.notion.so/) or any other repository you have available that both you and your employee can have access to.  Is that it?  No, you have to make sure to communicate these expectations to your new hire.

#### Step Two: Regular Communication
Besides the time you take initially with your employees when they join your team, it is important to spend time individually on a regular basis and go over your specific list of expectations for them.  Often managers try to do this in a weekly team meeting, but the effectiveness of that is questionable since the information conveyed will not be applicable to all and your employee may feel intimidated to share what difficulties or problems they are facing in a group setting.  During your one-on-one meetings share with them your list, show them where it is kept and help them feel comfortable to reach out if they have questions or concerns.  Be approachable, if they feel you are unreachable or too busy or distracted they will not reach out to you and in the end that turns into a detriment to your employee, your team, and yourself.  The advantage of a fully remote team is that all your communication can be recorded, logged and stored.  Of course this isn’t in a creepy “big brother” way but it can be valuable in reviewing as a manager.  This is especially true if you see a need for coaching, or putting together an employee counselling and review plan if you deem they are under-performing.  But how do you know if this is needed?  In conjunction with your list of expectations you have to set metrics for each one. 

#### Step Three: Establishing Metrics
As your company grows, your team will most likely grow too.  The expectations you thoughtfully put together and clearly communicated will need to be adjusted as this growth happens.  How do you make sure that your team members feel valued?  How do you make sure you have an accurate grasp on how your team is doing?  Establish metrics for each expectation set forth.  Be as specific as you can.  This can be done in a list form too, but it will most likely grow into a spreadsheet, or some other type of editable workspace.  There are several [tools](https://employeecycle.com/) for this, use one that works best for you.  Create your own dashboard for your team.  Remember these do not have to be shared with your employees.  Log metrics for your employees weekly, put in any pertinent data you see fit.  Did you have an employee on holiday or offline due to sickness?  Make a note of it so when you go back after a month or two for a review you will see that and adjust your expectation for that time accordingly.  A team leader that establishes and records metrics of their team makes decisions based on data, not on their “gut feeling.”  Data can help you back up decisions and sell them to upper management if necessary.  But more important than that, it can give you a clear picture of how your team is doing and what adjustments you need to make for the continued success of everyone you are responsible for including yourself.

As a manager or team leader of a fully remote workforce your job is not to set up a system to monitor your employees time.  It is to set up a system of clearly ideated and communicated expectations and keep track of the progress.  Give your team members the tools they need to be able to do their job and feel satisfaction from it.  Happiness and success in a remote work environment is not based solely on compensation, it is based on how your team members feel at the end of their day of work.  Do they feel they met and exceeded the expectations set out for them?  If so they will be more motivated to do the same thing the next day and the day after that.  But they can only feel that way if we have set those expectations, clearly communicated them, and have their metrics to be able to coach and help them to be successful.
