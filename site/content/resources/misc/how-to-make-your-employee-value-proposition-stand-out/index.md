Nowadays the words “culture” and “identity” are thrown about by HR professionals all over the world, but how does this really impact your employment offering.
Do you assume your offer is better than your competitors?  Or do you have a compelling case that outlines a clear Employee Value Proposition (EVP) that your prospective candidate has no choice but to say yes to your offer?  With the new remote workforce things like “culture” and company “identity” will be a secondary consideration to a transparent Employee Value Proposition.  What does your organization truly provide their employees and how does that match up with your competition?

#### Analyzing Your Employee Value Proposition (EVP)
Sometimes when we begin our hiring efforts with a new organization the first thing we do is take in the current marketing copy and put our own twist on it.  Maybe you meet with each department head and ask some general questions and then tweak some job description templates, or make a few posts on Linkedin about your new opportunity and how excited you are for it.  And while all of this may be incrementally beneficial, it really does nothing to help us fill those badly needed open positions.  Your network is still our same old network and the methods and tools you used at your previous company will not really be adequate for your new company if you actually intend to grow and develop as a hiring professional and as a human resources advocate.  Each organization is different and their needs are completely different.  With this in mind our goal as hiring professionals should really be to analyze our Employee Value Proposition and make it as transparent as possible.  Here are a few questions to consider, research, and answer when we are formulating our Employee Value Proposition to attract top talent.

 - What do we really have to offer?

 - Why should a prospective candidate want to work at our company?

 - What is in it for our candidate?
 
 - What can we offer that other companies can’t?

When you have clear and succinct answers to all of these questions only then can we start to put together our unique EVP.  Instead of talking vaguely about “culture” and company “identity” you can have something specific to back it up.  You can create a thesis that is supported by things like compensation, benefits, a remote work environment, and growth.  When you develop this cohesive and transparent EVP you can use this to attract top talent who might be having a hard time comparing offers.  In essence you are doing the work for them and in turn helping them see that your offer is the only one worth considering.  But how can you do this effectively?

#### Using Our Unique EVP to Attract Top Talent
First, analyze what your main goal is.  Is it to increase the number of candidates?  Reduce your time-to-hire?  Whatever your main directive is, identify your candidate persona.  You may have a dozen different candidate personas but if you know and define each one you can tailor your EVP to make your offer clearly stand out above the rest.  Once you have this you can decide what distribution channel is best for each candidate persona.  You might use one channel or multiple channels for this, using a first-class [applicant tracking system](/) can help keep your job postings organized and segmented for each persona.  Finally you want to keep track of your efforts.  Reporting features available in your applicant tracking system can help with this but you should keep your own dashboard to be able to see how effective your approach is and then be able to ideate and adjust as your organizations needs change.

When you take the time, energy, and effort to define your unique Employee Value Proposition you will have a compelling case behind your employment offering.  Instead of using vague marketing terms, appealing to emotion, or relying on your company's reputation you will be able to have a transparent EVP that will make your offer standout and guarantee you the top talent of today.
