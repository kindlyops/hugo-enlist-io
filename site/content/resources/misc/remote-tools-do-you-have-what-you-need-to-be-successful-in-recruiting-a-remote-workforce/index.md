A remote-first workforce is becoming the new business standard in hiring today.  No longer a bastion for digital nomads or old school coders, as we head into a possible recession companies are streamlining costs.
Overhead for real-estate, desks, chairs and all the other physical aspects of the typical office are getting thrown out the window.  Instead companies are focusing on how they can source talent from all over the world and make sure they are a fully functional and productive team.  As a hiring professional that means that the tools used for traditional hiring in the past need to adapt as well.

#### Remote-First Hiring the Workforce of Today
Remote-first hiring may sound like something new but really it has become common in many sectors of industry.  For example due to lack of housing and corporate real estate in Silicon Valley many companies have opted to hire fully remote independent contributors, as well as fully remote teams.  In addition, new job opportunities are increasingly contract based and many people are taking advantage of this by trading in one long-term position for shorter-term or more flexible work.  Intuit estimates that by the end of 2020 over [40%](https://http-download.intuit.com/http.intuit/CMO/intuit/futureofsmallbusiness/intuit_2020_report.pdf) of U.S. workers will be independent contractors.

#### Remote Applicants
A [survey](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/flexjobs-gwa-report-remote-growth/) done by The Global Workplace Analytics and Flexjobs found that remote work has grown 91% in the past ten years.  That is a huge change in a short amount of time.  Have your hiring tools and methods changed in the past ten years?  How about the past five years?  If sourcing the best talent in the remote-first workforce isnâ€™t a priority in your organization now, it will be soon.  This means that instead of hiring for one position you may be doing project-based hiring, or hiring for one job multiple times a year.  How can you keep up to date and organized for this new way of looking at work?

#### Maintain an Active Candidate Pool
Instead of trying to find new people for each new project, look at the scope of work that needs to be done.  Meet with your department head, your project managers and your C-suite and ask what type of jobs, tasks, and projects are ongoing and scheduled.  Then identify the specialized skills needed, make a list.  It might be ten or it might be a hundred.  Out of this list identify complementary groupings.  This might seem like common sense but you would be surprised how many hiring professionals fail to do this and in turn make the mistake of onboarding someone that fails to meet the minimum requirements for getting the job done.  Of course staying organized is key and fortunately today there are a plethora of ways to do this.  Using Applicant Tracking Software [specifically designed](/) for remote hiring is a necessity.  This will help you maintain an active candidate pool of remote talent that you can pull from throughout the year saving you time, effort and costs in your recruiting process.
