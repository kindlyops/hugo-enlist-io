Networking is about connecting with people.  Showing up when others need you, or being helped by someone you didn’t expect.  The world is not in a normal situation right now and for many of us, we are realizing that our network is bigger and more supportive than ever. If you have the experience of being furloughed or recently unemployed with no prospect of getting work anytime soon you may be relying on your network for that next opportunity.  Where do you see your next job opportunity?  What can you do to source help from your network?  How can you give support to others? 


#### Are You In The Right Field?
Now is a good time to analyze this question.  Don’t be afraid to do a deep dive into your reason for pursuing the career you have up until this point.  Think about how you got to the point you are at now.  What was it about your job did you really loved?  What did you dislike?  This can be a good exercise to start off with and as you go further into our own career path and trajectory ask yourself one more question:  Where do you see yourself next?  Start off with a job title, what is the job title you really want to have?  And then, ask yourself the really hard question:  Why?  Maybe we realize that we don’t really know why we want that job opportunity.  Or maybe the reasons we thought we wanted it are no longer important to us.  These questions may uncover a truth you previously did not have time to be concerned about, you may be in the wrong field.

#### Post About It!
The power of networking is not only to land your next job opportunity, its to find valuable information and gain insight into the industry you want to be in.  It will help you create a train of connections that will help you get to your destination.  It will also help you really see if that is the destination for you.  Begin by taking some time to post about your situation.  It is important when you do this to be honest and human.  Don’t ask for more than what your network can provide.  Let your network know your situation, your desired job title, and ask for advice and the next steps on how to make that a reality.  Initially, you may get one or two people that respond, that is okay!  Those one or two people may be able to connect you to two or three more and this can continue until you get to the place where you know what to do next.  Be specific in your questions and intentions and be respectful of that individual’s time.  After a week or two of reaching out and connecting with professionals in the desired industry you are targeting, take time to analyze what you have learned so far.  Do you really want to pursue this path?  If so, put together a plan of action on how to achieve it.  Taking the time you have now to talk with people and make human connections not only can help you, but it can also help others to feel valued.

#### Give Back
All through your journey to a new job opportunity you can give back to your network.  Let your network know you are taking “office hours.”  Set aside time on your schedule on a regular basis to leave open for others to book time with you.  Set up a [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) link and post it on Linkedin, let your network know you are available to connect with and answer any questions they have that you can help with.  You may have valuable insights into how someone else can get to their next opportunity.  This does not have to be an extended amount of time, consider ten or fifteen minutes a week and do it until your calendar is no longer being booked.  In this way, you can give back to your network and also show others you are willing to connect and do what you can to help.  This goes a long way, especially as those you come in contact with see your willingness to help they may in turn be willing to help you.

During this time of crisis, human interaction is a resource we all have to give.  Connecting with those we have worked with in the past, those we have met at conferences, or maybe have never met in person can be intimidating at first.  But being upfront on what kind of help you are looking for and taking the time to help others can be a great way to start feeling connected and comfortable.
