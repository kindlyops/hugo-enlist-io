 Applicant Tracking Software (ATS) has been around for at least 14 years.  Companies like Recruitsoft, Recruitmax, and Brassring were first in the nascent HR tech stack.  However the work force has changed dramatically since then.  Candidates no longer seek one long term employer, they seek shorter-term jobs that allow them flexibility and to grow in a dynamic workspace.

Remote workforces are the new normal but surprisingly most hiring professionals today use the same exact ATS from 14 years ago.  You may not recognize Recruitsoft, Recruitmax or Brassring but that is because today they have different names.  Oracle, Taleo and Kenexa/IBM are still used for traditional hiring.  Can a tool created that long ago really be cutting edge today?  The simple answer is no.  Recruiting and hiring for the remote workforce of today requires a completely different ATS, one that can allow for remote candidates to be recruited for a project or contract multiple times a year.  An ATS that is specifically designed for recruiting a remote-first workforce.  A Remote-First ATS optimizes recruiting, curating, and maintaining an active candidate pool of remote talent.

#### Active Candidate Pool for Remote Talent
Updating your careers page is one thing, but keeping track of multiple postings on multiple job boards can get out of control quickly.  A Remote-First ATS helps you not only organize postings but it will retain candidate information.  Just because one candidate is not right for the job you need done now, doesn’t mean they won’t be the right candidate for the next job.  Why take all the time effort and energy to comb through new candidates for every project when you could re-use or cultivate an active candidate pool to draw from.  Using candidates for multiple jobs over time can help develop rapport and trust.  In this way you will create trusted “consultants” easing your hiring burdens in the future.  They will enjoy all the benefits of remote and flexible work while also becoming more familiar with your organization and their specific needs.  A Remote-First ATS can help you retain these valuable candidates, and help you reallocate your hiring budget for other priorities.  Remember job ads cost money!

#### Job Ads Cost Money, Don’t Waste It Save It
How many active job postings do you have?  Ten, 20, 30 or more?  That can really take a large chunk out of your hiring budget.  How can you get the most ROI from your ad dollars?  Here are two examples on how you can quantify this:

Example One:
A business typically has at least three people involved in the hiring process.  You, CEO, and a department head or manager.  How many hours per week does each person spend on hiring-related tasks? For example, a member of your HR team might spend 30 hours of their week on recruitment and hiring activities. 30 hours per week x $20 per hour = $600 per week. With this info, you can start looking into tools to help reduce the workload and make better hiring decisions faster. For example, a solid applicant tracking system (ATS) could reduce the hiring workload by 30% or more. $600 per week equals $31,200 every year. 30% savings would be $9360.00 per year. The Cost of a [Remote-First ATS](/) per year is only $7748.00 at that rate if ONE person uses it you are saving $1612.00. With every new user you add to your Remote-First ATS your savings goes up, and guess what [it costs NOTHING to add users](/). You can have as many as you need for your organization your cost does not go up, but your savings do.

Example Two:
Let's say you're spending an average of $300 per month on advertising each open position. If you have 10 open positions per month, that's a total of $3,000 on job ads alone.
Job advertising (A) = $300
Open positions (OP) = 10
A x OP = $3,000

But let's say you advertised for five similar positions just two months ago. If you have a system for automatically collecting and pre-screening applicants, you already have a pool of awesome talent to choose from. Well done! You just saved 50% $1,500 per month because you decided to hang on to your recruitment leads instead of heading back over to the job boards for every new position.

If you use a [first class Remote-First ATS](/) which has an awesome reporting feature, you can make sure you're tracking which sources give you the best quality leads so you can stop wasting money sourcing candidates in the wrong places. $1500 per month of savings is $18,000 per year!

By using a Remote-First ATS you can get the most ROI from your job ad dollars.  This means you save time today and budget more resources for the future.
