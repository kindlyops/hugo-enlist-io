These times have created a huge shift in transparency in both work performance and in the workplace.  Recruiters and hiring professionals that have made a career out of leveraging their proven expertise are having a hard time.  These days you may find yourself with time on your hands.  Your hiring contracts and open positions may be canceled or temporarily postponed.  If they are resumed, no doubt the scope of work and the specific need will have changed greatly.  In turn, your expertise will be re-evaluated in relation to how your perceived performance will be in this new circumstance.  How can you make sure you are building trust and confidence in your expertise even during this time?  Here are six things you want to make sure are an expert on in your organization.  Having the forethought to collect, analyze, and recruit based on these six pieces of data will clearly position you as the expert you know you are.

 1. Historical Data - Segment your historical data to get the clearest picture of your organization.  For example, one piece of information you can look at is Time to Hire.  Knowing the typical time to fill a job by type, department, hiring manager, hiring budget, and so forth will give you a firm grasp of how long you may need to fill an open position.  By segmenting this data and using it in your discovery meetings you will be able to put yourself at an advantage.
 2. Candidate Market Data - What is the current market?  While this is changing as more and more people find themselves without work, knowing and packaging together insights like current supply and compensation is basic.  Categorize this data by geographic location, if you need talent for a remote area you will be able to see if you can source that locally or include a relocation package into your compensation offer.  Keep this current as things change, you don’t want to find yourself making promises based on outdated information.
 3. Passive Recruiting vs Active Outreach - What are the current statistics for your organization?  What about your hiring managers?  Your team?  Yourself?  Not knowing this information puts you at a huge disadvantage when planning your recruiting strategy.  Some recruiters leverage all their skill and experience in knowing this information then fail at keeping it current.  During these times it is important to know all of the different processes that are being practiced in your organization.
 4. Conversion Ratios - Know the data, how many candidates are coming from in-house recruiting, contractors, or referrals.  Out of those candidates who were hired and when?  What stage in the hiring process were they selected and what stage in the offer did they say yes?
 5. Diversity - You may know your organization’s policies and initiatives but do you know the statistics?  Do you know what the current diversity metrics are?  Take it a step further, how does your organization compare with its competitors?
 6. Hiring Manager Engagement - Do you know your hiring managers?  Having concrete data on who is actively engaged in the recruiting process and where their candidates come from will prepare you for how to work with that person.  It will also give you an idea of how you will need to communicate with them in order to move the hiring process along.  Even if there is not a direct business need to engage with every hiring manager, do you know who they are and how your team interacts with them?

Some of this information will be easily accessible.  For example, things like candidate origin and conversion ratios should be accessible with a [quality applicant tracking system](/).  However other areas like hiring manager engagement and diversity metrics may require talking to multiple people on multiple levels.  You may feel you have a firm grasp on these points of data but as you go through this list you will see where your gaps in knowledge are and where you can segment and refine that data to make it more valuable for you.  Create your own dashboard and update it as you come across a new piece of valuable information.  Now is the time that everything is being re-evaluated.  Your expertise is being re-evaluated.  Take the time now while you can to grow in your knowledge base, refine your processes, and engage with your organization.
