 Talking with hiring managers about their immediate needs can be an exercise in frustration.  And that is partly our fault.  The world of talent acquisition has been big on buzz words and not so big on actually connecting people so important work can be done.

In addition, hiring managers may only spend about five to ten percent of their time actively recruiting.  They are not in the position to change the scenario recruiters often find themselves in, you are. If you are tired of spending most of your time selling a hiring manager on your candidate list and want to spend more time actually recruiting and connecting people with amazing organizations you have to start by asking better questions.

#### Take Your Time with Discovery
Asking better questions starts with a quality discovery meeting.  There are many terms for this meeting used in today’s hiring lingo.  Basically, this is the meeting where you talk with the hiring manager to find out what kind of candidate they are looking for.  Some recruiters use this time to pitch their services to the hiring manager or they use it to close the deal on their recruiting contract.  This is NOT the time to do that.  If there are outstanding business issues still open do not schedule a discovery meeting, schedule a general meeting and put away any outstanding concerns so that trust and rapport can be built.  In this way, you will set a solid foundation for good communication going forward.  That being said talking with hiring managers can still be frustrating.  Asking quality questions that really explore all aspects of what is needed is important.  First, begin by trying to discern what kind of candidate you will need to be looking for:

 - What does the candidate need to accomplish in the first 90 days?  What about the first 180 days?
 - What are the needs of the team that this candidate would be a part of?  Are there any skill gaps that need to be addressed?
 - What is the scope of work?  Is this project-based?  What is the impact of this role?  Does it have the opportunity for future growth?

#### Make Sure You Are Both Looking For The Same Candidate
Next, try to get on the same page with the hiring manager.  Just because someone says they need a “rockstar” is not sufficient.  What is a “rockstar” to them?  What is their idea of the current job market?  The following questions can help you determine what your hiring manager is actually looking for.  Call it a calibration test:

 - Would you agree that this role and company (for example. Content Marketing Director at Linkedin) would be a similar profile to what you are looking for in a candidate?
 - What would be tasks that could be easily mastered by on-the-job training?
 - Why would someone want to work for your organization? 

These guideline questions will help you to really peel back what is actually needed by this hiring manager.  It will also help you see where you may be able to negotiate some concessions based on the candidate.  

#### Set Realistic Expectations
Finally, you want to do both yourself and the hiring manager a favor by setting realistic expectations.  They may need someone in a week, but realistically it will take you a month or more to find someone with the qualifications that are needed and then another month to convince them to meet for an interview.  Talk about these things upfront.  This will help the hiring manager know if they may need to temporarily reorganize their team to meet the business needs.  It will also help you to have the time you need to recruit a quality candidate and deliver the results you promised.  It can also open up more tools for you to use in your recruiting efforts.  For example, if the hiring manager really needs someone in a week are they open to offering higher compensation?  Knowing this BEFORE you start recruiting can save time negotiating between the candidate and the organization you are recruiting for.  This can be a tricky conversation, here are some guideline questions you can use:

 - Have you ever hired someone that did not meet ALL of the minimum job requirements?  If so, were they successful?
 - What are some of the things that you would value in a candidate that is not on a resume?  For example certain behaviors, soft skills, etc.  
 - What are the consequences if this position remains vacant for a month?  What about three months or more?

As a recruiter, by asking better questions you can take the headache out of dealing with hiring managers that may be too busy or too out of touch to realize what kind of talent is available in the job market of today.  This may take multiple meetings or calls but the effort is well worth it.  Over time this will also help you to build a strong relationship of trust with your hiring managers.  You will position yourself as the recruiting expert you already know you are.
