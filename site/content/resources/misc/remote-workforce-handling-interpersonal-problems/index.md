 While the world currently is in a state of turmoil causing many to stay home and out of sight, these serious times have caused serious problems.  Some of us, on the other hand, may have been able to see an immediate silver lining.  Working from home meant that we no longer had to deal with our arch-nemesis at work in person.

The person we dread interacting with, the individual that we feel makes our job more difficult.  Working from home may have been a quick easing of work-related tension initially, however as time goes on and our working from home continues that frustration will rear its ugly head again.  Maybe it is in the form of an email that was unnecessarily copied to our direct boss AND all our team.  Or maybe it is a complete lack of response to any of our requests for much-needed business information.  Whatever your situation is currently, conflict will come up at one point or another.  How can you effectively deal with it in a remote setting? 

### Types of Conflict 
**Misunderstanding** has been the cause of much conflict throughout history and unfortunately, the workplace is no different.   Working on a remote team can be a breeding ground of misunderstanding if we are not careful.  What did that Slack message mean?  Why did I not get copied on that email?  Especially if we are new to working remotely it can be easy to lose sight of context.  And depending on our team and how we interact with each other it may be our first inclination to automatically assume the worst.  **Poor communication** can cause conflict.  If our co-worker forgets to let us know a vital piece of information that causes us a lot of problems and undue stress, we can carry that undue stress and frustration onto the next day and so on.  This can cause a persistent conflict with that individual.  **Poor planning** is also another large cause of conflict.  Especially during these difficult times when plans made one day can be canceled the next day due to new developments in the world, it can be easy to blame someone rather than something for our frustration.  **Poor hiring** can lead to us having to pick up the slack for an unqualified and poorly performing hire on our team.  All these things can cause conflict between us and those we work with.  That conflict when left unmitigated can turn or remote office into a place of resentment.

### Underlying Causes of Conflict
These aforementioned conflicts really boil down to three distinct underlying issues.  Understanding those issues can help us mitigate these conflicts in a peaceful way and help all parties involved to move forward and develop a good working relationship. **Situational conflict** is the root of many difficulties in poor communication, poor planning, and poor hiring.  It is the situation that has been created that is causing interpersonal conflict between you and your co-worker.  **Value conflict** can be at the root of many misunderstandings.  This tends to happen with purchasing resources for company use.  You may highly value a trip to solidify a client relationship.  However, the individual approving the expenses related to your trip may not.  **Ego conflicts** can be the most difficult and can create disastrous problems for both yourself and your organization.  This type of conflict can show itself simply as a fear of being thought of as making a wrong decision.  That small fear can cause an ego conflict that can stop productive work.  Understanding these underlying causes of interpersonal conflicts can help us to deal with them in a productive way.

### How to Mitigate Conflict
Instead of taking things personally, we can take a moment to step back and go through potential steps for mitigation.

- Acknowledgment - admit that there is a conflict that is causing a strain in your working relationship and ask yourself what type of conflict is it? What is the underlying cause of this conflict?
- Don’t be afraid to communicate - even if you have a strained relationship with your co-worker, try and create an atmosphere where you can reach out and communicate with them.  This may start out as a direct message on Slack checking on their well being.  Many times if you show genuine interest in someone it can help soften your approach.
- Focus on the issue - during conflicts its easiest to blame the person and not look at the issue.  Is this simply a misunderstanding that has created a situational conflict?  It is hard to find the answer if we only are looking at our co-worker’s faults.
- Stick to what is real - make sure you are looking at facts.  If you do this, you will weed out any hearsay or gossip that might be clouding your judgment.
- Connect face to face - Zoom is a beautiful tool that allows us to see the face of who we talk to.  What may seem like a barrier to a remote workforce can actually be a huge problem solver.  Many times we are more candid talking to someone face to face online than we would be meeting that person face to face in the office.
- Make a plan and move forward - come to an agreement on what needs to be done, put a plan together and share it with your co-worker.  Then move forward with the plan.  Refer back to it if frustrations come up again to identify if the plan is not being followed or needs to be adjusted.

Dealing with people can be difficult, and everyone is different so each conflict is different.  Working remotely does help ease tensions that may have been present in the past however it is not a cure-all.  Understanding your interpersonal conflicts and what is causing them will help you to navigate your work relationships peacefully.  By making the effort to mitigate interpersonal conflicts you are changing work-life for the better and in turn you are creating solid relationships that can make you, your team and ultimately your organization stronger.
