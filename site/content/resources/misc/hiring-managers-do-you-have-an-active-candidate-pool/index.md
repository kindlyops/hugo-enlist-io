As a business leader, you have a lot on your plate.  You have Zoom meetings, projects that are moving ahead, and of course your team to manage.  What happens when you realize you have an urgent business need and you should have hired someone a month ago?  As a manager, it is your responsibility to hire for your team.  It is your responsibility to ultimately source, recruit, and hire your next top performer.  But for many hiring managers, this is a monumental task.  A task that they usually outsource with often frustrating results.  This is because hiring managers don’t actually hire people that often and when they do they tend to start from scratch.  How can you make sure that you are hiring proactively instead of reactively?  One way is to start by setting reasonable expectations.

#### Set Reasonable Expectations 
Hiring may be a small part of your workload so, like all seldom used skillsets, you may have to take some time to get into a hiring mindset and formulate a process to help you make your hire.  Many organizations outsource this to a recruiting service, or your human resources department may help you in your recruiting efforts.  Initially, this may give you peace of mind knowing a hiring professional is there to help.  However, if you have unreasonable expectations because you are not educated on the current state of the job market you are setting yourself up for an experiment in anxiety. Here are a few signs you may need to get a little education before you start your hiring efforts.  You find yourself saying to your recruiter:

**“I know our compensation isn’t the best but I only want to see people from Google or Facebook.”**  
**“I want to have all eight members of my team in the interview.”**  
**“I need someone who will be a rockstar from day one.”**  
**“I need that rockstar by next week.”**

Set reasonable expectations from the beginning, take the time to meet with your recruiter.  Have them educate you on the current job market and then give them the time they need to source quality talent.  Agree on a time to meet again and stick to that time.  Let them work for you.  But what can you do in the meantime that will help you hire proactively in the future?

#### Develop Your Own Active Candidate Pool
Instead of starting from scratch every time you need to hire, wouldn’t it be nice to have a group of people that you know to be able to reach out and see if they would be interested in joining your team?  Professionals you have met at networking events, conferences, even your own social circle may have the skills you need today.  Maybe you have interviewed someone in the past that didn’t quite fit the business need at the time but now would make a great addition to your team.  Use an [applicant tracking system](/) to curate your own active candidate pool.  Most organizations have an applicant tracking system (ATS) they use.  Inquire with your human resources team to see which one your organization uses and create an account.  A good ATS will allow you to easily login and will be intuitive enough to be able to navigate your way to creating your own active candidate pool.  Use this is a candidate repository, tag individuals with information that is specific to you and your team.  You never know who may be looking for another opportunity.  Having all of that individual’s information easily accessible so you can reach out to them with just a couple of clicks will put you a lot further ahead in your search than sourcing talent from scratch.  

Hiring may only 5% of your job but it can cause 95% of the headache.  Set reasonable expectations from the beginning.  Take the time to educate yourself on what is going on in the job market today.  Keep your own active candidate pool so you can proactively reach out to people you know you want to hire.
