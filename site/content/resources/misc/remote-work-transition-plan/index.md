As the economic effects of Covid-19 push more and more brick and mortar businesses to close, you may find yourself in the unfortunate situation of looking for work. While many have spent time adjusting to working from home over the last several months if you have never had the opportunity to work from home, it can be intimidating to start. [While there are several insightful guides to help you navigate the day-to-day of working from home](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/im-new-remote-work-help-myles-cordova/).  Here are five aspects you may want to consider before you start your new remote work life.

#### Get Dressed
This one sounds basic but is really important.  Any professional will prepare themselves for the activity they are about to engage in.  For example, a marathon runner would not wear denim shorts on a run.  Physically they have the ability to run for a long period of time in denim, but realistically they would not get the best results and they would be sacrificing short term comfort for a long term discomfort.  Getting dressed to go to work even though you are not “going” anywhere is the same.  You may be able to work in your pajamas, but that does not mean you do your BEST work in your pajamas.  Also, if you are looking for a remote-work opportunity getting dressed every day helps keep you in the right mindset to seek out the job that is best for you.  Treating your job-hunt as your time to begin working from home can help in your remote-work transition.

#### Create A Productive Space
Having a space to work in may sound like a basic step to begin working from home, however, you would be surprised how many people skip this step.  This is often seen when you Zoom with someone, often times when their background is full of clutter and chaos their work is cluttered and chaotic.  Your space does not have to be elaborate, but it should be functional.  It may be a space you have to set up every morning to begin your working day, and that is fine.   A good rule of thumb is to make things as easy as possible to get online and get into a productive mode.  Plan for things to go wrong and make adjustments as needed.  This space can and should evolve over time as you get more comfortable with working from home and identifying what you need to be able to be your best.

#### Video Quality is King
In the new remote-work environment how you are seen on video calls is how you are seen by your colleagues and most importantly your manager.  If you are constantly having technical issues with your video, your team will find it more difficult to work with you.  You do not have to have a professional production studio at home but there are some important guidelines to consider.  First, get logged on early.  This way you have time to fix any technical issues you may have BEFORE your meeting starts.  Second, make sure your video is only showing what you want it to.  This goes back to creating a workspace geared towards professional productivity.  If you do not want people to know what your home looks like do not set up your camera in a way that shows your living space.  Pick a corner with no distractions in your background and make sure you have plenty of light so your team can see your facial expressions.

#### Sound Quality is King
Making sure you are seen online is key, but making sure you are heard is just as important.  This does not mean you have to spend excessive amounts of time or money to get the perfect sound.  Record yourself on your computer with whatever microphone you have available.  For most of us that will probably be the microphone built into your laptop, most operating systems have an audio recorder included with your software applications.  Make a brief test recording and see how it sounds.  A couple of things to remember is to make sure you sit close enough to your microphone so that you are heard.  Second, be mindful of background noises that can drown out your voice.  For example, a fan or television on in the background may not sound that loud in person, but your microphone can pick it up and then amplify it to your team on a video call.  Lastly, log on to your video call early so you can make sure audio is working before your meeting.  This will save you from an embarrassing lack of audio when you finally have something meaningful to contribute to the conversation.

#### Set Office Hours
If you are looking for remote work, or you have started working from home recently, keep a schedule.  Set “office hours” and be consistent with keeping them.  This helps your team know when they can expect you to be online and available to talk with.  It also helps you to have a separation between your working time and your home time.  Lack of balance in your working schedule can lead to burning out.  On the other hand, if you do not have a definite schedule you may find yourself starting work much later than you anticipated and then in turn working longer than you thought you would.  This may be okay once in a while, however if this becomes your default you will most likely not be able to have that job opportunity for very long.  At the very least, you will not find yourself as productive as you could be.

Incorporating these five principles into your remote work transition plan will greatly help you land the job opportunity you are looking for.  If you already have found remote work but are finding that you are not as productive as you thought you would be see which one of these guidelines you may not be currently incorporating into your work from home routine.  By making sure you are put together, people can see and hear you, and they know when you are available and when your not you will be able to successfully transition to working from home.  How your organization sees you online may be the only way they ever see you, make sure you have the professional presence you would have if you were working together face to face.
