Hiring metrics might be a distant thought right now, however as your organization re-forecasts and updates its current and future growth strategy you may find that you still have positions to fill and that begs the question, what metrics really matter today?  Although many businesses are [closing for now](https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicamelton/2020/03/25/startups-failure-coronavirus-hit-and-venture-capital-slowed/#78d84eb667cd) or waiting for [government funding](https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-generation-of-start-ups-could-be-wiped-out-without-government-bailout-11967096) to keep the doors open, hiring efforts are still moving forward for [many](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/software-developer-jobs/).  As job opportunities still need to be filled some of those less affected by current circumstances still want that top talent today.  During this time hiring managers may still have unrealistic expectations when it comes to the current job market.  Working with current hiring metrics can help you educate and collaborate with hiring managers to be successful despite the current economic downturn.  Time-to-hire, Cost-of-hire, and Candidate Quality are the three variables that you can use to make your recruiting efforts really count with hiring managers in your organization.

#### Time To Hire
“I need someone yesterday.”  As a recruiter, you might hear that often in jest, however for some situations that might be true.  Crucial projects with tight deadlines may be key in your organization’s continued success.  But a lot of times, the time to fill the position in need may be longer than your hiring manager is willing to wait.  In addition, once a suitable candidate pool is sourced, it may take a hiring manager considerable time to move them through the hiring process.  With that in mind, set a realistic timeline for your hiring manager.  Once you lay out the time involved in filling that position, you can discern what your metric is in this regard.  This will help you weigh this metric in relation to the other two important factors you have to consider, cost-of-hire, and candidate quality.  If time is REALLY of the essence, is it that important to stick to the standard salary for the position set by your organization?  Or does your hiring manager really need someone with ALL the requirements they have asked for for the position?  Or can some of those skills be taught on the job? 

#### Cost Of Hire
Now is a time when most organizations are carefully reviewing and taking stock of their resources.  Budgets set in December of last year are now being completely overhauled to weather this economic storm.  The cost of your potential hire may be the biggest metric your organization values at this time.  If that is the case you should hone your recruiting efforts to align with that metric.  A top-quality candidate found in a short period of time may sound like your hiring efforts are paying off however if that candidate costs more than your organization can afford right now your back to square one.  If cost-of-hire is non-negotiable than review what metrics you are negotiable.  You may need more time to fill that position or you may need to educate and or calibrate with your hiring manager on what type of candidate quality your organization can really afford. 

#### Candidate Quality
What if you have a very specialized position to fill?  One that requires very particular skills that are set in stone.  If this metric takes precedence over cost-of-hire and time-to-hire than recruit for that metric.  Be honest with your hiring manager, it may take you an extended amount of time to find the right candidate, and it may cost your company much more than they think it will.  Communicating this BEFORE you start your search will save you and your hiring manager from wasting time, energy, and effort.

Ideally, it would be great if you could source, and recruit with only one hiring metric in mind.  But, that will seldom be the case.  View these three hiring metrics as an equation that needs to be balanced.  You can add resources to one or two metrics but to balance out the equation you have to take away resources from the third one.  Often recruiters may have this in mind but in their excitement to get on to the next challenge they realize that the candidate has been overpromised and the hiring manager has been oversold.  Use these three metrics to make sure you have a balanced recruiting strategy.
