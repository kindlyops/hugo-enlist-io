[As previously mentioned here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-interviews-phone-calls-later-myles-cordova/) despite touting a message of hope and empathy during these times most companies cut off all communication with a candidate after they have made a decision that they would not be a good fit for their organization.  This happens all throughout the interview process, which for many organizations is quite lengthy and arduous.  But what if that didn’t happen?  What if a company culture was concerned with a candidate experience that matched their employee experience?  Here is another wild idea, what if you asked a candidate that you did not hire their feedback about your hiring process and interview experience?  

#### Ask for Candidate Feedback
Talking with a candidate that you may have passed on may sound intimidating, but what if it wasn’t?  What if you gave such an amazing candidate experience that all of your interactions with the candidate were positive?  This may sound unrealistic, but in reality, think about the interactions you have with others.  For example, in your workplace, if someone presents an idea that you do not particularly care for, how do you let them know?  Oftentimes you show them respect as a fellow human and as a teammate.  Treating a candidate as a future teammate will help you deliver an experience that shows them the dignity and respect they deserve as a fellow human.  Interviewing dozens of people for one position is no longer a common practice for most organizations.  The cost involved in sourcing and recruiting alone would not be sustainable.  That being the case having a step in your hiring process to follow up with a candidate you have interviewed with is not an unreasonable task.  

#### Your Hiring Process Is Broken
It is established that the current accepted hiring process is broken.  Why try to paint it in a way that it is not?  Scheduling a candidate for multiple interviews is appropriate when deciding from a select few who would best fit your team or the needs of your organization.  A hiring process that is not organized enough to include every team member that needs to be on the interview is not acceptable.  In addition, when you interview a candidate multiple times you enter into a social contract.  You are asking for their time and attention, and in return, they are providing you information about themselves.  You owe the candidate respect in reaching out to them in a human way and let them know the opportunity went to someone else.  Many hiring managers are scared to death of doing this for fear of legal reprisal.  But the information you divulge does not need to be specific to them, it is not about what you are saying, it’s about how you are saying it and when you are saying it.  Candidates on the job market today want to know what their options are and by being conscious of their time and communicating in an open way the opportunity is not going to them you are delivering a high-quality candidate experience that reflects well on you and your organization.  

#### It’s Up to You To Fix It
Hiring managers and recruiters do not ask for candidate feedback and the current accepted hiring process used at most organizations is not humanized or compassionate. Organizations will not fix this, it is up to you to implement a human-centered approach.  As a People Ops leader, It is up to you to work with your recruiters and hiring managers to make sure their hiring process is your hiring process.  A process that treats people with the respect and consideration they deserve, especially during these difficult times.  That may sound like a daunting task but it is possible.  The next article in this series will provide some solutions you can easily implement in your organization today.
