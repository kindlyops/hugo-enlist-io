Challenges have come up in almost every industry and recruiting and hiring may have seemed to slow down for the time being but the challenges faced pre-pandemic have been amplified.  Problems like finding quality candidates, working with hiring managers, and general collaboration between people have been serious issues.  Meeting these challenges in the context of working remotely can be difficult.  Time to hire has been one of the metrics of paramount importance and that has not changed.  If you are feeling overwhelmed by managing this metric while working remotely you are not alone.  Here are four guidelines you can use to manage your time to hire from home.

#### Organization
Things become more manageable when they are organized in a way that provides context and clarity.  This is true of most challenges and for recruitment and hiring this may be doubly so.  If you are not organized in your hiring process your time to hire can grow exponentially.  Start by mapping out your full hiring cycle.  For some of you who deal with only one aspect of the hiring cycle, this is still extremely important.  Your time to hire may be affected by another aspect of your organization’s hiring process that you are not even aware of.  By mapping this process out from beginning to end you will find out where your time to hire is lagging.  This map doesn’t have to be complicated but it should be as detailed as possible.  For example, if you are not sure what your hiring manager’s process is, ask them.  It will help you to organize and give clarity to what is really slowing down your time to hire.

#### Implement The Change You Have Control Over
When you analyze how much time every step in your organization’s hiring process takes, you may be surprised by the results.  What you thought was affecting your time to hire may not really be the issue.  The time-waster in the hiring process will be different for everyone.  Put your time to hire challenges into two groups, what you can control, and what you cannot control.  Implement change in what you do have control over.  Consider the time added to the hiring process that you do not have control over.  How much time does it add?  There may be nothing you can do to change that however by factoring it into how it affects your time to hire you will be able to be much more accurate in your judgement of how long it will take to fill a position.  In turn, you will be able to update the metric in your organization and add transparency to it.  Many organizations assume the factors that affect their time to hire and most of the time they point the blame to the recruiter they are working with.  

#### Automation Helps
Look at what aspect of the hiring process you have control over and refine it.  This may mean migrating your hiring process from a low tech approach to a more high tech solution. For instance, instead of using spreadsheets to house your candidate information us a [competent applicant tracking system](/).  This way you can add time-saving automation that will reduce your time to hire.  Key automation is expected by most candidates and when you do not provide them it can slow down the hiring process.  Things like an acknowledgement of resume submission, thank you emails, and even scheduling interviews at a time when everyone involved is available are all things that can be automated inside an applicant tracking system.  There are many other tools you may be able to implement that will help cut your time to hire however, they should be used to refine your hiring process and not to be your hiring process. Automation can cut time to hire but it is not a cure for a broken hiring process. 

#### Execution Is Better Than Perfection
Your hiring process should always be changing and improving.  The current pandemic situation has changed so many aspects of hiring and interviewing, what has worked in the past will naturally need to change in order to keep up.  This change does not happen all at the same time and it does not happen overnight.  When streamlining your hiring process to cut your time to hire start with the changes you can make today.  Executing ONE change that will improve your time to hire is better than doing nothing.  Sometimes it is easy to get lost in the analysis of what needs to be done and you end up doing nothing.  Execute what you can, do not worry about if it is going to be perfect because it will most likely lead to another change and so on as you continue to refine your process to meet the challenges of tomorrow.

These four guidelines are a straightforward way to reduce your time to hire.  They will also help you add transparency to your hiring process and identify what are the challenges your organization is facing.  Currently hiring may be on the decline but that does not mean the positions that are open do not need to be filled as soon as possible to make sure your organization can accomplish what they need to.  Organize your hiring process and see what you have control over in order to refine and execute change that will help reduce your time to hire.
