Recruiting has taken a significant downturn and the rate of unemployment has taken an equally significant upturn.  If you are one of the fortunate ones to still have work you have something you may have never thought you would ever say out loud.  TIME!  Right now, time is the only resource that we have in abundance.  How are you using it?  Most of us have projects we have started but never finished, in a busy economy there was more important things to do.  Today we are going to take a look at two projects that you can complete now while you have the time, so you can weather the difficulties that will come up in the near future.

#### Start Your Own Advisory Board
Depending on your organization when you directly reach out to hiring managers, directors, or department heads you seldom get a response.  Do you need input from all departments regarding something that will directly pertain to them?  Even if you send out a thoughtfully crafted email you may have no real hope of a reply.  But what about during these slower times?  Create your own cross-functional committee.  Reach out directly to those in your organization who have shown interest in your organization branding or have in the past expressed vocal input regarding implementations you have put in place.  Ask them if they want to join your advisory board.  This can be a great resource for your future hiring efforts.  Thinking about purchasing a certain HR software?  Or retooling your onboarding process so jobs will close quicker?  Think of this group of enthusiastic colleagues as your personal sounding board.  Often their thoughts and opinions will be a good reflection of how those in your organization will feel.  You get the benefit of diversity in thought and leadership and this can help your future efforts to make your company culture more cohesive.  You will be able to create buy-in from these key individuals in your organization and that will be a huge help with implementation.

#### Quantify Your Efforts
Most C suite executives view the human resources department as a cost center.  No matter how hard you work, how quickly you find the best talent when it comes down to the end of the
quarter, and the end of the year all of those efforts are not reflected in the profit and loss statement.  What is a part of that profit and loss statement is the cost of you and your team to your organization.  This is true especially now.  While you have time and resources available quantify your efforts to your organization in dollars and cents.  As an HR professional this is most likely not your strong suit so make friends with someone in your organization who is deeply familiar with the type of financial reporting your company uses.  Connect with them and ask for their help.  Build an excel model showing the amount of capital allocated to you and your department, then show how much your efforts are really bringing to the bottom line of your organization.  There are a ton of [resources](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/hr-tech-roi-email-course) available for this however this is not a one time project.  You will need to review and update this every time your budget is being renewed.  This will take time and effort but laying the groundwork now, will help you to justify you as a business need and help shift the perception of your team as a profit center instead of a cost center.  Getting familiar with the way your CFO speaks and what they value as a part of their job function will go a long way in being transparent and showing the real dollar value of your efforts.  This will help you in making decisions in the future when you may have to pivot to other strategies as your organization changes post-pandemic, and it will also help you to get approval from your CFO for a tool or job opening that you really need.  

In the recent past, you would have never had time to start an advisory board or do a deep dive into quantifying what you and your team are bringing to the table.  But things have changed and going forward the skills and strategies you used to find valuable will prove unfruitful.  The next half of this year will prove challenging and what you do with your time now will determine if you are prepared to meet that challenge.
