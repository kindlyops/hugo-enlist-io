For many, the challenges that everyone is facing right now has been a trigger to change our priorities.  The worries of a pre-pandemic work environment are not the worries we face today and will not be the worries we face tomorrow.  The anxiety and fear of realizing the lack of control we have in our society especially when facing injustice and lack of resources can be crippling.  You are not alone in those feelings.  Initially, our main concern may have been with our physical health.  Am I safe?  Is my personal space clean?  Did I remember to sanitize everything that I need to?  While these are valid concerns, as life goes on during this pandemic there has been a void that many are not talking about.  Your emotional health.  How can you deal with stress and anxiety when there is no end in sight?  Here are eight ways you can make sure your mental health is as big of a priority as your physical health.

#### Take It One Day At A Time
Everyone has anxieties and concerns that cause stress on our mental health on a daily basis. With this in mind recognize that there are some things you cannot control.  Things that come up in your life that you have no control over are not worth worrying about.  It may be hard to do at first, but taking it one day at a time will help you manage that stress.  It is good to remember that worrying about a possible scenario that most likely will not happen, and is out of your control, will not help you accomplish what you need to do that day.

#### Be Reasonable
You know yourself better than anyone else, what can you reasonably do in one day?  What about one week?  If you are still having a hard time being realistic about what you can do, think about other mitigating factors that you may have not had to deal with before.  Lack of childcare or lack of a proper workspace are very real issues during this time, it is okay you are not alone.  Factor in the issues that pertain to you and your situation and adjust your expectations.  Your workload and your responsibilities can be re-balanced to be made more manageable, but it takes being reasonable in what you can accomplish with the time you have.

#### Identify Your Stressors
It may be difficult to identify what adds stress and anxiety to your life.  When you feel like you are overwhelmed take a moment to pause and think about what specifically is causing this.  Take a piece of paper and write out all the things you are thinking about at that moment.  What can you not get out of your mind that keeps coming up?  Is there anything on that list that you can eliminate?  What are some of the things that you have no control over?  As you evaluate your list of stressors try to see them from a different perspective.  Will this issue matter in a month?  Why or why not?  Sometimes by zooming out and seeing the bigger picture it can put smaller things in their proper place and in turn you can better deal with that particular stressor.

#### Stay Organized
According to a [recent article in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html) you may procrastinate when you are suffering from poor emotional health.  Staying organized is one powerful way you can avoid dealing with stress by procrastinating.  Put together a reasonable schedule and stick to it.  Try it for one week and assess your results.   If you are feeling better that is great, if not try to make adjustments that will help you avoid procrastination.  

#### Keep Your Priorities
Setting priorities in your life help can greatly improve your emotional health.  List your priorities out, then grade them on how important they are.  Move your most important priorities to the top of your list and set aside meaningful time for them in your schedule.  The more you have control in accomplishing these priorities, the better you will feel.

#### Be Balanced
Being reasonable in what you can do is one thing, but being balanced in how you do it is another.  Being balanced in how you use social networking, your phone, and other devices can reduce stress and anxiety.  Working from home may seem like a stress reliever, but if you do not set aside time to relax and spend time doing something else it can become a prison.  When you do things you enjoy you boost your emotional health, so whatever that means for you take the time you need for that boost.  

#### Maintain a Good Physical Routine
Sometimes your personal routine can run into a rut.  That can start to have negative effects on your emotional health.  A good physical routine can help you get out of that rut.  Physical activity can also help your body deal with stress in a positive way.  It can serve to both relieve stress and to deal with the stress you have to live with.  There is a [plethora of information on this](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240003927?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIub6y8eqP6gIVzRErCh3Neg0cEAAYASAAEgLTGfD_BwE), but the point is to maintain a good physical routine that works for you.

#### Ask For Help
Comfort in a time of crisis can go a long way in taking care of your emotional health.  But what if no one knows how you feel?  Ask for help.  Reach out to your colleagues or your manager and let them know what tasks you need to delegate.  During these stressful times everyone needs assistance in one way or another, do not be afraid to ask for the help you need in order to maintain your emotional health. This can help in two specific ways, for one it can help reduce your stress and anxiety by knowing that you have a network of support.  It also allows you to express your appreciation and gratitude towards your team.  

Just like not washing your hands or keeping social distance can put you in danger physically, not handling the stress and anxiety you are facing during these times can cause an emotional danger.  Neglecting your emotional health in the short-term can have long-term effects.
