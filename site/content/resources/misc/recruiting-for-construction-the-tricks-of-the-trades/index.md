Those that have changed their hiring process and their company culture to develop with the current workforce have reaped huge profit and those that haven’t have remained stagnant.

Companies like [Iron Mechanical](https://www.ironmechanical.com/), [Fluor Corporation](https://www.fluor.com/), [Jacobs Engineering](https://www.jacobs.com/) and [several others](https://www.zippia.com/advice/biggest-construction-companies-in-america/) are changing the way they hire and revamping their hiring process to be able to keep up with the demand.  According to the [Bureau of Labor and Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/construction-laborers-and-helpers.htm) the construction industry is expected to grow over eleven percent in the next few years, if this is your industry what are you doing to keep up with that growth?

#### Construction of Today
Every state and region has different regulations regarding various aspects of the construction industry, some areas work out of their local worker’s union while others have the opportunity to source talent by whatever means available.  While it may seem like a nice arrangement to show up at the local union hall and ask for a certain amount of skilled tradesmen and then wait for them to show up for your project the reality is there are many more skilled professionals you will need to get the job done.  Project Managers, Security Advisors, and Architectural Engineers are in high demand and the competition is winning top talent by adapting their hiring process and their offer to meet their hiring needs.

#### Working With Unions
About half of the [top tier high demand construction trades](https://esub.com/top-ten-best-paying-construction-jobs/) are usually controlled by a local union.  That means that you don’t have to do the recruiting, but you do have to make sure those relationships between your organization and the specific trades union you work with are strong.  You also want to consult your local union laws and make sure you are following the best practices so your project is not delayed.  For example, some postal codes in the same city or region have different laws and different unions.  Making sure you are following the specific requirements for each area is key, also keeping these requirements and best practices updated in one central area will help your team and your hiring managers stay on top of what they need to know and execute.  Using an [applicant tracking system](/) that is customizable helps you organize your workforce and your projects by this key information.  You can use custom hashtags to organize by postal code, trade, project, or any other value you need to be able to identify.

#### Working With Contractors
Hiring skilled contractors may be more straightforward.  Many organizations use [Simply Hired](https://www.simplyhired.com/), [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm), Craigslist, Linkedin or their own custom job board to post their open positions.  However posting to all these different job boards and channels takes time, hiring for multiple positions in multiple areas complicates this even further.  How can you stay organized and make sure you are giving a candidate experience that will win you the skilled contractors you need in the time you need it?  Organize your hiring process, and [use tools](/) that help you stay that way.  By having a centralized tool that allows you to create, manage, and post job listings to multiple channels with just a couple of clicks you will have the time you need to focus on other more important tasks.  Adding automations like auto-responder, text and email verifications and candidate visibility into the hiring process you will be able to make sure you are giving the best candidate experience possible.  This will help you win skilled contractors for your projects and organize them into an active candidate pool that you can dip into for future recruiting so you can multiply the return on your investment of your time energy and effort.

#### Hiring Processes that Win
The burden of hiring for a project deadline is usually a shared one.  Between Human Resources and the hiring manager for each position there is alot to coordinate and wires can get crossed.  You might think you are waiting for that promising project manager to respond to you but in reality they may be waiting for the same thing.  When you finally have time to double check your written communication you realize you were supposed to send them important documents weeks ago.  By the time you reach out to them now they have accepted another offer from a competing organization.  Don’t let this happen to you.  Now is the time to re-tool and focus your hiring process.
