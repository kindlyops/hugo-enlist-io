As a hiring manager, you have no doubt posted a job opportunity to your network with a link to apply.  In the beginning, your post had positive comments and reactions, but as time went on your job posting didn’t receive the response you thought it would.  Maybe you even got some direct messages asking if your connection could just submit their resume directly to you.  This may be a sign that good candidates are getting lost in your hiring process.  You can be doing all the right things to get your job opportunity in front of the eyes of the qualified candidates you desperately want, but the tools you are using can be burying their responses.  As applicant tracking systems have developed into a big business over the years, for many their functionality has not kept up with the current needs of a modern and agile organization.

#### Big Business, Small Functionality
Hiring has changed night and day over the last ten years.  Previously you used to post a job opportunity on a popular job board and wait for the resumes to come in, or you had to work hard to get someone’s email address or phone number if you were sourcing a candidate.  Nowadays that is all done in a couple of clicks, at least in theory.  As hiring processes have changed, the tools used primarily have not.  Instead of innovating, applicant tracking systems have been consolidated into pre-existing solutions.  Often these are enterprise only, making any kind of customizations a large expense and this forces many organizations to adopt other, additional solutions that offer more functionality.  This causes two problems first, your organization is paying for an expensive solution that no one wants to use.  Secondly, with individual hiring managers using different systems, the hiring process gets fractured and becomes impossible to unify. 

#### ATS That Works For You, Not The Other Way Around
Fractured hiring processes within a single organization can lead to many problems once a candidate has started the trip down that road.  But the most common issue happens before a candidate can even start that journey with your organization.  High-quality candidates can be caught in your applicant tracking system and marked as not qualified without you or anyone in your company ever seeing them.  Projects and postings are moving forward and time to hire is getting longer and longer.  That enterprise software you thought was the professional standard may instead be giving you amateur results.  The applicant tracking system that is being used by your organization most likely has been designed for the lowest common denominator.  Meaning it is a one-size-fits-all approach, how can this meet the needs of your organization?  How can this help your hiring process?  It simply will not, and the result is many organizations adapt their process to fit the applicant tracking system, instead of utilizing the agile processes that are often pioneered by enterprising hiring managers.

If you have not evaluated the applicant tracking system being used by your organization, take the time to do it now.  Good candidates could be getting lost and your tools may be getting in the way of your hiring process.  This series will consider why this is happening and what you can do to make sure you are using an applicant tracking system that works for you, not the other way around.
