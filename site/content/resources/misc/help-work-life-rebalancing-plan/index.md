As weeks have turned into months under lockdown and sheltering in place, working from home for some has become more of a nightmare than a dream.  You might be feeling overwhelmed and overworked, or you might be struggling with focusing on the task at hand.  Watching your Netflix queue diminish while your work piles up.  Both situations can cause anxiety and stress and both require a rebalancing plan to help you gain a sense of productivity that is grounded in a satisfying mix of work and personal life.  Here are some principles that can help you make the changes you need in order to cultivate a work/life mix that is best for you and your goals.

#### Social Context
People often tend to do well when they recognize and work within the social context of where they are at the moment.  For example, sleeping while at work is usually not acceptable because the action is not appropriate to the social context of where that individual is.  Working from home, while convenient and necessary has muddled this context.  This can lead to two things, the most common being working too much and burning out.  The second is not as readily admitted but it may be not working enough.  Social context plays a huge role in both of these challenges and they are not unique to you, they are being faced by many who have transitioned to a remote work environment.  When we step through the office door, mentally our perception shifts.  It is working time because you are in your workspace.  Being high performing or productive in that environment to some degree relies on the fact that your perception changed once you walked through those office doors.  In reality, you just changed your location but mentally you changed your focus and shifted to the responsibilities of your job.  Creating that same mental shift in focus while at home is key to help you balance your work and your personal life when your location for both of those things are the same.  Ultimately it is your responsibility to change your social context to define the appropriate work/life balance for you.

#### Demarcate Your Space
While working from home changing your social context to “working mode” may be the less challenging part of your work/life rebalancing strategy.  You have responsibilities that require your attention, communication to respond to.  Setting up space where you can effectively do that may be simple at first.  Demarcating your space to have a home office area where you can be productive is important to set the right social context.  But when this space is in your home it may be hard to log off at the right time.  Staying on a little longer to respond to an email or joining an ad hoc video conference meeting can turn into multiple late nights in a row.  At times that may be necessary however it is important to set some physical space between your work area and your home if possible.  By being able to physically step away from your working area you can step away mentally and refocus on your personal life.  Set a reminder on your phone to walk away and close your laptop.  By moving away from the physical space where you were working you are creating a different social context and the act of getting up and being away will help you transition to shift your focus to other more personal priorities.  Taking this time and committing to this action will go a long way in rebalancing your work obligations so they fit into your personal obligations, not the other way around.

This also works the other way.  Maybe your challenge is not working too much but not focusing enough on the tasks you need to accomplish.  If you are apt to spend hours binge watching Netflix while trying to work maybe the couch is not the best space for you to make that shift in your mental focus.  Instead of working on your couch in front of your television, set up your laptop on the dining room table or if you have an office desk in your home, use it.  Sitting upright and away from distractions can help you make that change in your perception and help you accomplish what you need to do.  Another aid in this is to make a physical task list and keep it by your side.  Block out time to complete these tasks.  There are many [great methods](https://blog.trello.com/how-to-pomodoro-your-way-to-productivity) and applications that can help you do this.  When you find your attention wandering it can serve as a reminder to get back on task.  

#### Balance
While time management and a physical change in location (albeit a small one) can help you make the appropriate social context shift between your work and your personal life, balance is the foundation of an effective work/life rebalancing plan.  That might sound trite at first, but having balance really means prioritizing your time so that you can achieve your goals.  As a professional you have goals and as an individual in this world you have goals.  Look at ALL of those goals and allocate your time and energy in a way that will HELP you to reach them, not hinder you from achieving them. Whether you are suffering burnout from overwork, or not able to focus for long enough to complete your work the underlying issue is that you are not reaching the goals you have set for yourself.  These may even be unconscious goals, for example, spending more time with your family.   You may not have written that down as a goal, but if you feel you are working too much and not spending enough time with them then your unconscious goal is voiced.  Give yourself a foundation to be balanced.  Write down, verbalize, and establish what goals both personally and professionally are important to you and let them shape the time you spend pursuing them.  

Finding a work/life balance that works best for you while working from home is not simple.  It requires self-analysis.  What is important to you?  What are the goals you want to achieve personally and professionally with the time and resources you have access to?  Even if your only goal right now is to have relief from the stress you are currently feeling, make that a priority and allow yourself the resources to achieve that goal.
