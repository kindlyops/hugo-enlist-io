What companies are doing now, during difficult times will shape their future if they have one.  People Ops leaders, recruiters, and hiring managers should be thinking about how they treat candidates now and how that will ultimately reflect on them.  [A recent post by Shaneé Moret](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shaneemoret_shaneemoret-linkedin-hiringmanagers-activity-6686637799602458624-Jt28) really highlights the biggest example of cognitive dissonance in the hiring process today.  Now more than ever people are in desperate need of job opportunities.  Talented and highly skilled people are vulnerable and scared about what will happen to them.  Companies have shaped their messages and pivoted their business to be more “compassionate” in light of the current pandemic situation however, hiring practices for those same companies have not changed.  Shaneé used her platform to show a prevalent hiring practice.  Looking through Linkedin, you can find thousands of posts about people dropping everything because of the possibility of an opportunity, only to be treated like cattle in an assembly line.  People Ops should be about PEOPLE.  Recruiting should be about partnering with talented professionals.  Hiring should be about humans.  

#### People Ops Should Be About People
People Ops should be focused on helping the people in your organization.  As a People Ops leader you should be concerned about not just how your team is treating people, but how is your organization treating people?  Driving a cultural change in your organization requires more than carefully crafted inter-office memos and facilitating open communication.  Thinking holistically about how you are shaping people’s interactions with your organization, the hiring process adopted by each recruiter, and each hiring manager you use will give off a message.  The message that many companies are sending out during these difficult times is a dehumanizing one.  For a candidate experience with your organization to be summed up as “three interviews and no phone calls later” is not acceptable.  It sounds like a hiring process issue, and it definitely is, but it's really a People Ops issue at the foundation.   What is acceptable in your organization and how have you enabled that?

#### Recruiting Should Be About Finding Partners
Sourcing and recruiting candidates like you did before the global pandemic is not acceptable.  Calling candidates, scheduling interviews when it is convenient for you, and pushing back when it is inconvenient for your candidate is not a human-centered approach.  Neither is blowing off the interview ten minutes before it was scheduled AFTER you pushed the candidate to interview at the time YOU wanted them to initially.  This may sound like an extreme example but a casual look at those in your own network will reveal this to be a common experience.  Finding your hiring manager a talented candidate that will help them is a priority, but how you do it will determine how you are viewed going forward.  What kind of candidate experience do you have a reputation for delivering?  Will people want to work with you when hiring picks back up and opportunities are more plentiful? 

#### Hiring Should Be About Humans
Structured interview processes can give clarity in assessing a candidate’s talent, but how rigorous are you making an interview process for an opportunity in your organization?  Is this a legacy job opportunity?  No, especially these days staying in a job for more than ten years is a thing of the past.  With that being the case, why do hiring managers treat their opportunity like it has duration for the rest of a candidate’s life?   Even when you do find the candidate that is right for you, how are you communicating with them?  Do you have an onboarding experience that shows respect to your candidate, or do you “throw them into the fire” and hope they succeed?  

These are all problems, problems that unfortunately are still going on.  Why are these practices still considered ok in the workplace?  In addition, can you really say you give an amazing candidate experience if these practices are a part of your hiring process?  The next article will discuss WHY this is still happening.  In the meantime, let’s discuss these issues together.
