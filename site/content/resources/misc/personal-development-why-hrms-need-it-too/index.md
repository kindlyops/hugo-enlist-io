Naturally, over time as humans we grow accustomed to our environment.  Maybe you have gone back to the town you grew up in and noticed how much it has changed.  But when you talk to someone who never left the area, they say things are just the same as they have always been.  This happens in our work environment too.
More often than not we do not even realize it is happening.  It could be one month or one year and to us things feel the same but in reality they have changed night and day.  This can deeply affect how we develop as a professional.   We may be so busy with our day to day responsibilities that we stop putting in the time for our own personal development.  Ultimately it is up to each one of us to continue to grow and develop.  What are you doing to make sure you have the skills you need to be successful?

#### How to Put a Plan Together
There is no shortage of acronyms and systems you can use to put your personal plan together but instead of getting lost in the process start things out as simply as possible.  All you really need to begin is a pen and a piece of paper.  Consider the following questions:

 - What makes me uncomfortable?  
 - What do I wish I was competent in?
 - Who do I want to be, is there a mentor or leader I want to be like?
 - Ultimately where do I see myself in one year? 

These questions may seem broad but if you actually take the time to think about them you may be surprised with your answers.  They can be hyper-specific to your current responsibilities or they can be general.  Maybe you want to learn a certain piece of software or maybe you want to have better work-life balance, write down any and everything you want to accomplish.  Also looking at one year time blocks is important, view your self development plan as a living breathing document.  It should change as you change.  Doing this important introspective work will help you set the foundation for what kind of professional you want to be now and in the future.  It will also help you determine what needs to happen next.

#### Set Goals
 - Differentiate between definite goals and ongoing goals. **A definite goal** is one that you can physically complete and be finished with after some effort.  For example learning [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/en-in) or becoming an Excel Guru.  These are skills that you can learn once, then use it for the foreseeable future.  An **ongoing goal** is something that you will work on over a much longer period of time.  An example of this could be to be more decisive, for this goal you will want to set some sub-goals to be able to benchmark your progress.  What does this ongoing goal really mean to you?  These are things that you will measure and re-iterate as you continue to develop them.
 - Set aside your definite goals and set a reasonable time for completion. 
 - For ongoing goals set reasonable benchmarks for each one.  In one month what change do you want to see?  How about in six months?  Write these down and set dates.  Remember these dates and goals may change over time as you reassess and re-evaluate how valuable these ongoing goals are to you.

 #### What Happens Next?
Right now you should be in a good place.  You have thoughtfully identified and focused on your goals for the next year or more.  Now it is time to prioritize your goals.  You can really do this any way you want however you may find it easier to prioritize your goals once you really look into what resources are required for each one.  Do you need to purchase a certain book?  Do you need to register for an online class?  How much does it cost?  When is it available?  If you define the resources needed for each goal it will help you automatically prioritize them.  Maybe you donâ€™t have the money or time for one right now, but you will in six months.  Then set that goal for later and assign an appropriate date to begin.  After looking at what resources are required for each goal you may have several you can start on right away.  Begin with those and you will find that your time, energy, and effort will be greatly rewarded.  As you complete goals you can re-allocate your resources to move on to others that may take more to develop and accomplish.

#### Track and Save Your Progress
Nothing on your list will stay the same, and that is okay.  Keep track of what you have accomplished.  You can do this in any way you want, some people have used [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) or [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) so they have access on all their devices.  The important thing is that you do it regularly.  At least once a week check in and see what progress you have made, if you continue to do this it will help keep your goals in mind and help you make decisions that will help you reach those goals.  When you look back in a couple of months you will see what you have accomplished.  That satisfaction will help motivate you to continue moving forward.

#### Iterate Over Time
As your life changes, your goals will change.  Personal Development is an ongoing process, if you work at it you will be able to notice the changes going on around you and within yourself.  This will help you reach that next level as a professional, whether that may be a promotion, or a better work-life balance.  See what works and what you have gained the most benefit from.  If something is not bringing as much value as you thought it would, scrap it and move on.  It may be that you do not have the proper resources for that particular goal.  If you feel stuck that is okay too.  Talk about your goals with someone you trust.  Get their opinion and feedback, this will help hold you accountable and help motivate you to continue on.  Take the time to put your plan together and take the resources you need to put that plan into action.  Explore all options both inside your organization and in your area.   Your company may have a mentoring program, an educational reimbursement you can take advantage of or a free workshop you can attend.  These all can be valuable if you actually use them.  Do not let time continue to pass without examining how you can grow as a professional.  Take your pen and paper and start your development plan today.
