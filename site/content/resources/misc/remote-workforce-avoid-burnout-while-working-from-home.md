 As the world has embraced remote work, what was once a new and novel idea has become normal.  For some of us experiencing remote work-life for the first time, we are approaching a month into our new routines.  As humans we find comfort in our routines, we find security in our routines.  Right now we are all looking for comfort and security, but is too much of a good routine damaging?

While throwing ourselves into work can help us alleviate the anxiety of the current world situation, burn out is real.  Burn out can creep up on us and damage our mental and physical health.  How can you avoid overwork in your new routine?  And what does a healthy work-life balance look like?

#### Overwork
In the past employers shied away from embracing a remote workforce because they assumed it would enable under-performance.  But as we see, assumptions have changed.  The remote workforce has grown 400% since 2010 according to [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200122005406/en/).  What employers now realize especially during these stressful times is that they have increased productivity so much so that for many in this new routine overwork has now become the main issue.  Before you may have enjoyed a mental shift as a result of your environment.  In the office you knew you eventually had to leave, and this brought along with it certain social context.  For example, if you received an email at midnight you knew that you could ignore it completely until the next business day.  It also may have implied that whoever sent you that email did not have a very healthy work-life balance.  The context was that if someone is at home they should not be on their work computer trying to get things done.  Now that has changed, for many we can choose our hours.  As a result you can be plugged in at all times.  Instead of working less, you are working much much more.  This may be comforting right now but overwork can lead to much more serious problems.  What are the signs of overwork?

- Physical and Emotional Exhaustion
- Cynicism and Detachment 
- Feelings of Ineffectiveness and Lack of Accomplishment

These can manifest themselves in symptoms like insomnia, lack of appetite, chronic fatigue due to stress and in many other ways.  It is important to analyze how are you doing?  How is your physical and emotional health?  It is easy to chalk these symptoms up to what is going on in with the pandemic however take a look at your work schedule.  During one week log the time you worked and the time you stepped away from work.  You may be surprised to find out exactly how much time you spent in “the office.”

#### The New Work-life Balance
If you are feeling the affects of burnout begin by taking a step back.  Instead of relying on your environment to create a mental shift or separation between your work-life and your personal life you have to take your schedule into your own hands.  This may take a little time to arrange however after you do, you will find that your new work-life routine will bring you closer to the comfort and security we are all looking for right now. Here are some steps to find your new routine.

- Log your working hours
- Analyze your organizations needs
- Analyze your productivity, when are you most effective?
- Make a schedule that works for you
- Create a space in your home for working

You cannot start creating a work schedule that works for you unless you know how much time you are spending on work every week.  After you have this data, see when your organization really needs you.  This may start by considering what time your team is online, being able to communicate in real time is important to getting things done.  Next take a look at when you are most productive, and see where there is overlap in those time periods.  Take all of this into consideration when creating your new routine for a healthy work-life balance.  Be sure to include meaningful breaks throughout your day.  Communicate to your team and your boss your new intended schedule and create a space in your home that is just for working.  You may have already done this, but if you haven’t, take the time to do it now.  Even if it is a temporary space, that may be a desk that you fold away at night or that might mean having a work computer and a personal computer.  When you “step away” from the office close your work computer and don’t look at it again until the next day.  If there is an emergency those that need you will reach out to you in other ways.  This will go a long way in helping you make that mental shift from your work-life to your real life.

There is so much going on right now and we all need our physical and mental health to be the best it can possibly be.  Don’t let that sense of security and safety you get from working be the cause of overwork and ultimately burnout.  We can be more productive than we ever thought possible while working remotely, if we have a schedule that has been created with our health and mental well-being as a priority.
