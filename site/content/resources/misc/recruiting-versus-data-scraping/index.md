Technology is moving at an incredible pace and so is business, but for many, their hiring practices are not matching suit. Instead of adopting new software, new techniques the glut of educational material for recruiters are focused on installing outdated chrome extensions to scrape contact data and profile information in mass quantities. Innovation is a word that is banded about by recruiters but in reality, it is far from the truth.

#### Recruiting Today

A useful Chrome extension can be a great tool, and as sites like Linkedin and Github change what they allow having multiple ways to find potential candidate information is vital. But is that where your recruiting efforts stop? Do you simply export that list of people, pick a few from the list and pass that on down the hiring process? That is the reality for many recruiters. They are only as effective as their boolean search. Does that describe you? Let’s take a look at how you can transition from a data scraper to a recruiting professional.

#### Recruiting vs. Data Scraping

Issue number one is usually your hiring goals do not align with your hiring efforts. Are you simply just trying to find people? No, you are trying to find that perfect candidate for the roles you have been assigned to fill. That includes more than just how you find contact information. It includes thinking about what type of individual would work best for the role, where you can find them, how you will organize and keep track of the candidates you find and reaching out to these potential candidates. Where do you start?

- Define your potential candidate persona - who really are you looking for? Hint, the words purple squirrel, and unicorn should not be part of that definition.
- Define an Employee Value Proposition for each persona. If you need help with your EVP [check this article out](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-make-your-employee-value-proposition-standout-myles-cordova/).
- Use your recruiting tools to find those defined potential candidates. This is more than data scraping, it is using your whole arsenal of tools and methods to find and communicate with the people you want for your organization.
- Stay organized, actually use [your talent tracking system.](/) Spreadsheets and task reminders will not help you see how effective your recruiting efforts are.
- Stay consistent, put in the work.

Use these principles as guidelines to transition from a data scraper to a professional recruiter. Make a plan every single morning about what you need to accomplish. You cannot have consistent, and measurable results without putting in a consistent effort. Are you sourcing and finding people EVERY SINGLE DAY? That involves more than mining profiles online. Think of it like you are following an exercise routine. Your output is dependent on your activities, how are you spending your day? Being a data scraper will not give you the results you are looking for. Use the time you have now to develop a consistent recruiting method. Consistency is key. Focus on your activities, track your results. In just a short period of time, you can be a consistent high output recruiter.
