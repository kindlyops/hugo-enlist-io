A remote workforce used to be a wild idea in the world of HR, now it is the new standard.  This has opened up new opportunities for many remote workers.  No longer being tied down to a certain geographical location has enabled some to make a move that puts themselves first, instead of their job.  When all your candidate needs is a laptop and high-speed internet this has led many to become expats, working in different localities and time zones across the globe.  As an enterprising recruiter, recognizing the value of sourcing from an International candidate pool will put you a step ahead of your competitors.  Here are some guidelines that will help you enable and manage, and develop your international remote workforce strategy.

#### Asynchronous Communication
Traditionally in an office setting, meetings are scheduled and everyone files into a conference room to attend.  Once their information is communicated, projects are discussed and people move onto the next item on the agenda.  Digitally this is done in a variety of ways, for example scheduling a zoom meeting or skype session where everyone is logged in and ready to discuss the work ahead of them.  But what happens if you are recruiting individuals from multiple time zones?  This can add a layer of complexity however it also can allow you to develop a strength in your team.  Develop asynchronous communication.  Not all members of your organization need to be on at the same time in order to work on the same project.  By developing methods of communication that do not rely on everyone being online at the same time you enable a more productive workflow.  For instance, as your development team in the United States is ending their day, your 
development team in Australia are beginning theirs.  If they have a method of “passing the baton” so to speak, you will find that you are leveraging an international remote team to be MORE productive than a traditional location based team.  There are many tools that can help you do this, set guidelines in place from the outset.  Communicate the expectation with your candidates from the outset.  Then as a hiring manager or recruiter and you will be able to source candidates that can work together while being located in completely different areas.

#### Replace Time Worked for End Results
In an office environment, compensation has been traditionally based on an expected time commitment.  This does not have any correlation to productivity since some people can get a certain amount of work done in eight hours and others get that same amount of work done in sixteen hours.  The guarantee however is that you will be compensated for your time.  By changing the mentality of hiring managers to start thinking about end results you will be able to gain real insights into actual employee productivity.  Some companies have tried to insert this into their work culture by providing “unlimited vacation time” but that is often promised and never delivered on.  In addition to this, those that are able to be more productive in shorter periods of time are often stigmatized by coworkers.  Replace time worked for end-results will help you build an international remote workforce that knows what is expected of them and it will hold everyone on your team to a higher level of accountability.  

#### Maintain Positive Communication
Asynchronous communication as mentioned above is a great way to boost the productivity of your international team however, maintaining POSITIVE communication is just as important.  In a remote workforce a common issue that arises is only communicating to your team when there is a problem.  While this is valuable to solve the problem at hand, it sets a negative pattern.  If someone on your team is a star performer, but you only communicate with them when there is a problem they may not realize they are as valuable as you feel they are.  This can lead to lack of employee retention and make it difficult to address difficult issues over video conferencing.  Instead, maintain positive relationships by communicating positively.  Let your team know how you feel about them and their work.  Take time to connect with them one-on-one so that both of you feel comfortable and you create a positive and inclusive working environment.  This is especially important if you are recruiting candidates from different countries and cultures.

With the possibility of recruiting and sourcing talent internationally as your organization shifts and maintains a remote workforce you have the opportunity for unprecedented success.  By making sure you establish expectations from the beginning you can make sure both the candidate and the hiring manager have a solid foundation to develop a productive working relationship.  When you add things like asynchronous communication, work performance based on real-world productivity, and positive communication you will be able to recruit and develop a diverse workforce and in turn cultivate diversity in your organization.
