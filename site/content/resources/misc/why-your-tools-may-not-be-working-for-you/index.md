Good candidates, the kind of candidates you are looking for to help you drive innovation in your organization could be getting lost in the filters.  As mentioned earlier (insert link to previous article) it might be time to reevaluate your applicant tracking system.  But you might be thinking about all the time, energy, and effort you have put into trying to navigate your current system and the thought of changing or augmenting your HR tech stack to be more agile in the hiring process may seem like a difficult task.  It doesnâ€™t have to be.  By selecting a partner instead of just a provider you will have all the help you will need.  However, the longer you wait to assess the more difficult it will be to implement the change you need to implement and how you can do it.

#### Outdated User-Based Pricing Model
Most applicant tracking systems used by larger organizations are seen as the professional standard.  However, tools that work in a larger, more systematic corporate setting do not usually translate to a smaller more agile organization.  The needs of the two are completely different.  Just because something works in a more static setting with many users is not a good indicator of how they will operate in a more active setting with a smaller number of users with varying needs.  Along with this, the cost of a license for many of these enterprise solutions creates another barrier in the hiring process.  All who are involved in the hiring process many times do not have access to the applicant tracking system that is housing all the pertinent information needed to give a great candidate experience.  Because the cost of adding a user to the system is cost-prohibitive, only a small and select few are able to use a solution designed for company-wide adoption.  This further fractures the hiring process as hiring managers and people ops groups start to adopt other more customizable applicant tracking systems for personal and team use.

#### Customization Frustration
Customizations are another issue that causes a further fracturing of the hiring process and in turn, can add to your time to hire.  As hiring managers take a more active role in the sourcing and recruiting process the real-world workflow they adopt becomes an asset to you and your organization.  This can lead to the creation of needs that are unique to your organization, which oftentimes get filled in by other software solutions.  This is because the customization of enterprise software comes with a high price tag.  This adds multiple redundant tools to the HR tech stack that creates an incohesive hiring process where one team uses certain tools and other teams or groups use other more disparate tools because of frustration with the company selected solution.  Here is where a change in viewpoint can help you in the refinement of your HR tech stack.  Instead of viewing it from the perspective of procurement, where you select a provider from a list of vendors.  Select an applicant tracking system as if you are choosing a business partner.  

This provider versus partner mindset is what will be discussed in the next article.  How can you choose a partner that will make your workflow easier and in addition be the agile support your organization needs?
