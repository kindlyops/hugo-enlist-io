As a recruiter, hiring manager, or HR generalist interviewing over the phone has been a practice used for many years.  However, for many, interviewing over video conferences was considered of lesser value than interviewing in person.  Fast forward to today and that has changed night and day.  Interviewing over video can present its own challenges and those challenges can be expressed and amplified if you are not taking a human-centered approach.  For example, if you are not comfortable with video interviewing OR you do not know how to use your organization’s chosen video conference service your interview will not go well.  This can be frustrating, especially after you worked so hard sourcing and recruiting that candidate for the opportunity.  Lost opportunities like the one described above add to your time to hire and can greatly increase your workload.  The skill of conducting effective interviews over video conferences will help you grow as a hiring professional and will make your employment offer stand out.

#### Be the Expert
When it comes to interviewing over video conferences you may think it is really up to the candidate to show that they are comfortable in communicating with you about their knowledge, skills, and abilities.  But that can really only happen if you create the right environment for the conversation.  Be the expert with your chosen videoconference tool.  Know how to create and host a meeting.  If you are relying on someone else in your organization to do this for you then you are adding to your time to hire.  Some key things to consider when setting up an interview:
  * Get the time right - make sure the time for the interview is in the right time zone and is the time you have agreed upon with the candidate.
  * Log on and start your meeting early - give yourself enough time to deal with any audio or video issues BEFORE the interview is scheduled to begin.
  * Begin the interview by outlining the process - let the candidate know what is expected so they feel comfortable communicating freely with you.

Once you are comfortable with the mechanics of how your video conferencing service works, you will be empowered to use it more effectively.

#### Speak To Be Heard
Being heard is important, it can shape how well you will be able to decide if the candidate is right for your organization.  If they cannot hear your question accurately it can create barriers to communication.  Two things to keep in mind is your volume of speaking and the equipment you are using.  Speaking over the phone is much different than over video conferencing, for many the tendency is to use the same volume for both.  However, with many video conferencing tools they automatically compress or lower your volume.  At a certain decibel level, the software will automatically mute your microphone.  You could be speaking at a volume you consider normal however it could be that what you are saying is cutting in and out for the candidate.  With this in mind, it is best to speak at a volume appropriate for an office.  Think about the last face-to-face interview you conducted.  Maybe it was in a conference room, how loud did you have to speak in order for the candidate to hear you?  While you were not yelling at them, you did have to speak in a louder voice than a typical conversation in order to make up for reverberation in a larger more open space.  Speaking over video conference can be the same, in addition to this depending on what equipment you are using your microphone may also adjust your volume up or down depending on how loud you speak.  If you are using the microphone built into your laptop this will for sure be the case.  Using an external microphone does give you an added boost in your audio quality.  There is an abundance of inexpensive options available that plug right into your computer via USB.

#### Listen 
Making sure you can be heard by your candidate is important, but listening to them is a key consideration.  Communicating over video can cause some natural overlaps in conversation.  For example, if someone pauses for a moment or there is a delay in the video stream you may think that the candidate is finished talking and jump right into a follow-up question.  In reality, the candidate is merely pausing for breath or dealing with a technical issue.  These “unnatural” pauses are common and until more and more people get comfortable using videoconferencing on a daily basis it is important to take these pauses into consideration.  Listen carefully to the thoughts expressed and if there is a brief pause that is ok.  Give the candidate the time they need to express themselves and help them feel comfortable in the process.

#### Facial Expressions Give Context
When a candidate can clearly see your facial expressions in an interview they are able to get a proper context and understanding of what you are asking.  Think about in-person conversations you have on a regular basis.  How much insight do you gain by seeing the facial expressions of those you are speaking with?  You may not realize it but seeing someone’s face can help us to understand their mood and how they feel about what is being said.  This is valuable for both yourself and your candidate and helps foster a human-centered approach in your interviewing process.  Make sure you can be seen by your candidate.  Ask yourself the following questions:
  * How is my lighting?
  * Can I clearly see myself on the screen?
  * How far away from the camera am I?
  
Taking these questions into consideration will help your candidate get the best interview experience from you and your organization over video conference.

Conducting effective interviews with candidates is your responsibility and in order to do that, you must create a comfortable environment so your candidate can communicate openly with you.  Doing this over video can be a challenge, but by being the expert and putting together a painless process, making sure you are seen and heard by your candidate, and by listening to them you will be able to make quality decisions and hire quality people.
