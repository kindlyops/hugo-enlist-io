As countries all over the world are starting to shut down for everyone's safety.  Many workplaces are following suit.  If you are fortunate enough to still have a job and are now looking at working from home you may feel some sense of relief.  However, if you have never worked from home before you may also feel some anxiety.
How will I stay free from distractions?  How can I focus on my work?  I miss my co-workers and getting out of the house, how do I stay positive?  If you have a plan to keep positive and focused during your time at home, you will feel less anxiety about what you can’t control and you will be better equipped to deal with other challenges that may come in the future.

#### Kill Distractions
Nir Eyal in his book “[Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life](https://www.nirandfar.com/indistractable/)” says, ”Our digital devices are buzzing at all times, world news demands our attention 24/7, and there are countless entertainment opportunities than ever before.”  This is true now more than ever, but if we are used to working in an office we adhere to certain social cues.  These stop you from sitting in the break room and watching television all day.  They may not stop you from watching YouTube all day at work, but it does stop you from doing it when your boss is walking by.  Co-workers coming to your desk asking for answers to their questions, scheduled meetings, and other obligations force you to be present in your work.   At home though, our social cues are completely different.  Home is where we relax, home is where we spend time watching tv, playing video games, everything you want to do besides work.  If we have families, these activities are added onto and multiplied.  If you find yourself working from home and you haven’t already taken steps to kill distractions, do it now.

- Block Your Favorite Web Sites - This includes YouTube, Facebook, etc.  Anything that you easily go to in order to escape from staying on task.  Do this on your work-related web browser, the sooner you do the better you will feel.

- Turn Off the Television - I know right now you want to be informed on any new information coming out but fight the urge.  If possible work in another area where you can’t see the television or maybe a spare room that does not have one.  You can always take a timed break and catch up on the news throughout the day just as you would in the office.  Take time to get up and walk around but limit it to a time you set in advance.

- Put the Phone On Silent - By silencing all notifications you can put your phone down and check it later.  This way it doesn’t interrupt you while you are in a good flow.

- Find a Good Space - During these times you are probably not the only one at home if possible find a space to be productive in, a guest room or in a pinch even a large closet can work.

#### Focus on What Matters Most
Now that you have made a space conducive for productivity its time to focus on your tasks at hand.  Make a list of menial tasks, things that can get done in a short amount of time but are tedious to do.  Then make a list of larger more involved items you are responsible for but need time to process and tackle.  Schedule your day out like you would if you were in the office.  Use your calendar and block out segments of time.  Try doing your deep work in the morning while you are the most productive and energetic.  Then in the afternoon schedule in some of the smaller more tedious work.  This helps you stay productive throughout the day instead of hitting a roadblock by working on something when you are really not in the right headspace to be doing it.  In the office, you may run into this issue all the time, but often we don’t think about it because there is another meeting or another distraction to break up our workflow.  Keeping focused on these tasks and checking them off one after the other will help you to continue being productive even if you really don’t feel like it right now.

#### Stay Positive
Freeing yourself of distraction, and putting your head down and working at home when you are not used to working in that space can be liberating.  It can make you ask questions like, “Why haven’t I ever considered this before?”  Or, “Why don’t we do this at my work all the time?”  However, after that initial euphoria of super-productivity fades you may start to get lonely.  Especially if you are in the home working without anybody else around.  That is natural, human interaction keeps us in a positive state of mind.  Social-distancing may seem like a godsend at first but if our situation persists for two or more weeks we may be anxious for human interaction like we have at the office.  Allot time in your work schedule to talk with your co-workers, give them a call.  Hearing their voice and expressing interest in them is much more beneficial than typing a message on Slack or WhatsApp.  You can hear their concerns, share in their anxieties and reassure them that things will eventually get back to normal.  This can help us stay positive, it can help us to be aware of those in our lives and be concerned with other people’s welfare not just our own.  

Right now anxieties are running high, and change can be scary even if it’s temporary.  But if you are new to remote work, embrace it.  Kill your distractions, focus on what you need to do and keep a positive attitude.  You will show your boss and your organization what kind of employee you are.  But more importantly, you will show yourself what kind of person you really are.
