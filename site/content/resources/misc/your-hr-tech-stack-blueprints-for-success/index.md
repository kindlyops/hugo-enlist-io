A blueprint of your HR tech stack is your source of truth for yourself as well as all your organization.  It is really just a detailed picture of all the processes and technology used by your organization for all HR functions from sourcing to onboarding and career development.  It is a clear picture of what tools your organization has.  It’s a communication tool to evaluate the current state of HR processes within your organization. If it’s a mess, then your results will be a mess.  How do you optimize and enhance your process without knowing what you have?  How do you strengthen the total effectiveness of your organization when your not sure who uses what tools to do what?  Here are **five steps** to help you create a cohesive blueprint of your HR tech stack for your organization.

 **Step One:**  Put together a complete inventory.  Identify all the systems you have, every piece of HR software your organization uses.  This may sound easy but most organizations don’t even know what they have in their HR tech stack.  They don’t know who uses what, or why they use it.  You will probably find software that your organization pays for but that no one uses or even knows about.  This might require you to go from department to department and see what they each use to get a big picture and a complete inventory.  Go to procurement and see what contracts are on file.  Go to finance, and see what your organization is paying for.  Another important part of this process is to observe what people are doing.  HR functions and HR tech will usually touch every aspect of your organization from the C-suite all the way down to a new-hire.  People may not know that they are actually using HR tech for an essential part of their job function.  This will take the most time and it may require a large amount of detective work, but you won’t know what tools and processes you have in your inventory until you complete this vital step.  

**Step Two:**  Ascertain the current state of your HR tech stack.  While you are completing step one take the opportunity to see what is missing, ask people what they like what they don’t like what would they love to be able to do.  This will help you see your current situation with objectivity and help you plan a road map to future success for your organization.  It will help you to meaningfully analyze what is needed and what is not needed.  Remember HR systems are not just for HR, they are used by almost everyone in your organization.  Often as an HR leader, you may feel that you are the only one concerned with these processes and tools, but in reality that is not the case.  

**Step Three:**  Create your blueprint.  Put together a complete visual of all HR functions and processes.  Indicate what software is used for what purpose.  For example, what supports compensation and benefits? Payroll? Talent Management?  It should reflect ALL systems in your HR tech stack.  Depending on the complexity and size of the organization this may be a thoroughly detailed document or could be an interactive [Lucidchart diagram](https://www.lucidchart.com/). This clear and accurate picture will be an invaluable resource for step four.

**Step Four:**  Analyze your strategy.  Take a look at the choke points and bottlenecks. Take a look at gaps in your blueprint.  This will help you strategize for the future.  What should your common language around HR be in our organization?  What data points do you actually need?  What processes do you actually need?  Keep these questions close at hand and use them to constantly refine your blueprint as the needs of your organization change.  For example how many systems does your organization use to post a job opening?  You may be surprised at the answer.  Three different hiring managers may be using three different systems.  As you analyze your strategy you will be able to have the answer to the question, is this piece needed in your HR tech stack?

**Step Five:**  Use the Blueprint.  Use it EVERYWHERE in your organization.  Many HR Tech stacks are a mess because of changes in technology, churn in HR staff, and general lack of overall strategy when making decisions on what to purchase and use.  This creates difficulty in storing and receiving accurate information.  Knowing what is being used in your HR tech stack and why will help you have a firm foundation for buying decisions in the future.  For example, your talent tracking system may no longer suit the needs of your organization due to size or change in business direction.  A blueprint will help you decide [which one to select](https://enlist.io/) to replace it and why.  

Using these five steps to create a blueprint of your HR tech stack will help you see where your tools are creating value and where they are not.  In a world where many of your HR functions may be on hold, take the time now to analyze, organize, and revitalize your HR processes and your HR tech stack.  Your blueprint is your source of truth, it is a detailed and transparent picture of your value to your organization.  It is a snapshot of your current success and a road map to your future success.
