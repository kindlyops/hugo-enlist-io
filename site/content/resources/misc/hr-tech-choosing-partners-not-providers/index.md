[As highlighted previously](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-your-tools-may-working-you-myles-cordova/?trackingId=zF%2Fav6FNSoz5ZNdddqe9eA%3D%3D), your tools your organization has selected may be hindering your efforts instead of helping you and your team do their best work.  Tools selected based on a procurement perspective will not give you the agile tools you need to adapt in the current situation.  Your applicant tracking system should be an asset in your HR tech stack and it should be helping you not only find candidates but also give a great candidate experience.  And lastly, it should be easy, it should not be a chore to access information or to add a new user to the workflow.  This can be accomplished by selecting a partner, not merely a provider.  But what makes a good partner?

#### A Partner is Reachable
Getting your specific question answered by your current applicant tracking system provider may seem like your asking for the world.  That is not how a partner to your business should handle communication.  Your partner in your HR tech stack should be reachable.  That means they will be available to actually talk with you when you have questions.  A chat feature that is monitored by a real live human is a start.  Make sure your partner at least has this functionality, where you can easily type questions you need to be answered and that feature connects you to a customer service specialist that can answer your questions and help you instead of just pointing you to a help article.  The next step is to be able to speak with someone face to face.  Zoom is great to be able to connect with your partner, this allows them to show you their functionality and share their screen in order to walk you through what you need to accomplish.  If they are not available to call, zoom, or chat with they are not really a partner.  And when your business needs change or your hiring process needs to adapt, a partner that can communicate with you will be one that helps work with you not the other way around.  

#### A Partner Works With You
You can tell a lot about an applicant tracking system when you are trying to incorporate it into your workflow.  How it fits in your hiring process will show you where the strengths and weaknesses are.  No system is perfect however if they work together with you, you will be able to meet the challenges that will naturally come up.  Are they willing to listen to your feedback about your user experience?  Are they developing new features based on that feedback?  Are they willing to dig into a problem you are having and helping you solve it?  These are the signs of an applicant tracking system that works with you.  You can expect them to be a support when you need it.   This should not be considered a huge ask, so as you work with and reach out to select a new system be open about your current needs.  Demo the product first, try it out.  Take advantage of the onboarding process and schedule the zoom call to go over how the applicant tracking system functions and how it can possibly be the partner you are looking for.  Also, don’t be afraid to ask for an extension of your free demo period if you need more time to make a decision.  This gesture of goodwill and intent can go a long way in determining if they will work with you and be flexible in your needs.  A partner will be more than happy to provide you with an extension, a provider will not.


So review the pathways of communication, imagine the worst scenario, and ask how they would handle it.  The answer may not be readily available however see how long it takes for them to respond and get you the information you need.  Take the time to demo the product, allow them to help you in the onboarding process.  The tools you utilize in your organization should be easy and agile for everyone involved in the hiring process to use.  By avoiding the “provider” mentality you can select a partner that will be adaptable to your needs now and will grow with you as those needs change in the future.
