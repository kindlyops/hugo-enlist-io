For most people interviewing has always been a source of anxiety.  Worrying about saying the right thing or doing the right thing, especially when you really want the job opportunity is stressful.  As remote work has grown due to the current pandemic, hiring a fully remote workforce has become a priority for those who are hiring.  Hiring a remote workforce starts with interviewing remotely, how can you make sure you are able to express who you are and your abilities over video conferencing?  

#### Set Up Your Interview Space
Video conferencing from home is different than in an office setting.  Your equipment and work-from-home area will most likely need to be addressed well before your interview is scheduled to begin.  Start by opening up your camera view.  This will be different for everyone for example if you are using the camera built into your laptop or an external web camera you will have completely different perspectives.  Access your camera viewer on your computer and make sure the camera view is showing ONLY on what you want it to.  This means taking a look not only at yourself but your lighting and what is being shown in your background.  Don’t want the person you are interviewing with to see your dirty pile of laundry?  Then make sure it is well out of the way of the view of your camera.  If you want to go one step further set up a video call with a friend and have them take a look.  A second opinion can help you notice things that you might miss because you are used to seeing it every day.  

#### Preparation is Professionalism
Preparation for your interview might sound like an obvious step, however preparing yourself to be able to navigate the video conferencing software that your interviewer is using is another issue that can bring its own challenges.  Most companies use enterprise versions of free software that is readily available to download and try out.  Zoom, Skype and even Google Meetings are all easily accessible to try out.  If you are not sure what video conferencing software your interviewer is using, reach out and ask.  It will show initiative on your part and you will be able to look like the professional that you really are.  Knowing how to do things like mute and unmute your microphone or share a screen view without sharing all the other things you may have going on in your desktop background will make you more confident and it will help the interview experience for both you and the person you are speaking with to go smoothly.  In addition, take time the morning of your interview and adjust your settings.  Make sure your mic and video are working and test them.  It may seem like a small thing, but positioning yourself as an expert takes more than just knowledge or certain skill sets.  Over video, it takes preparation to make your professionalism and experience shine through. 

#### Create An Interaction That Favors You
So you have made sure your audio and video are working and your space is set up to be conducive to you doing your best on an interview, which is half the struggle.  The other half is the interaction itself, the actual process of talking to someone you do not know online and communicating who you are and how you would add value to their organization.  Create an interaction that favors you.  You can do this by not being afraid to speak first.  Remember that the person interviewing you may be just as nervous.  Many hiring managers and recruiters have never used video conferencing to interview before, to help them to be comfortable with talking to you.  A couple of things to remember is that there will be “awkward silences” in the interview.  This is inherent in getting used to video conferencing.  Making sure the other person is finished talking BEFORE you begin speaking is a good starting point, but keep in mind that there may be delays in audio and video.  It is okay for there to be some long pauses in conversation than you may be comfortable with if you were talking face-to-face.  Secondly, remember that some things may get lost in digital translation.  If you cannot see your interviewer’s facial expression or they may have technical difficulties, you may need to set up an opportunity to circle back and re-engage with them.  This is ok, by mentioning this at the beginning of the interview you can put your interviewer at ease and put the conversation back into the context it was intended. 

Showing up prepared for an interview over video takes more than just making sure you swapped out your pajamas for actual clothes you would wear in an office setting.  It takes consideration, where are you going to have the interview?  Do you know how to use your equipment?  Do you know how to navigate the video conferencing software your interviewer will use?  Can they hear AND see you clearly?  By knowing the answer to these questions you will be able to position yourself as an expert and translate your professionalism, both who you are and the value you add over a video call with confidence.
