Looking for a job opportunity?  [It is a tough market right now](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/03/economy/may-jobs-report-preview/index.html), and there is a plethora of information giving tips and advice on how to stand out.  A well thought out plan to select and target future opportunities is vital now more than ever.  To begin you may think about your resume, your experience, who you would like to work for.  Next, you might start to consider who you will reach out to and how you are going to do that.  In planning your strategy you may have forgotten one thing that can help you in this endeavor.  VIDEO!  The term “content is king” may be outdated as now there is more content than ever, but is there content about you?  About your expertise?  About how you can help others?  Here is a concise guide on getting started publishing content about the person you know best...yourself!

#### Focus Outward
Creating and posting videos of yourself can seem intimidating at first, but instead of focusing on yourself remember the purpose of creating and sharing this content.  It is not so everyone can see your face, it is so you can provide value to others and connect and work with those that value and appreciate you.  Ask yourself specific questions that you feel need answers.  Maybe questions like: 

What is the biggest challenge your potential clients or employers are facing right now?  

or

What specific pieces of advice or guidance can I offer that client or employer today that will help them to face that challenge successfully?  

Come from a place of contribution, helping, giving, and sharing.  Don’t view it as projecting yourself or the most positive perception of yourself to the world, view it as a channel where you can give back to your network, your community, your colleagues.

#### Plan Your Content
Planning what you want to share can take time and you may be overwhelmed at first.  One way to help this process is to start things as simple as possible.  Find a job description you love.  Highlight key phrases and content that you feel you are an expert in.  What do you feel you can add value to?  It can be one topic that you break into several small videos or maybe it is a series of solutions you have implemented that you have found success with.  Share your expertise, your shortcuts, the tools you use.  If you are still having a hard time creating valuable content, start by telling your story.  No one has the same story as you, it is unique and it is something that has inherent value.  But you may be wondering how will this help me find a job?  It will help you to connect with your network, and introduce you to those that find value in your story and your expertise.  So start by establishing your expertise by creating two or three videos on things you are professionally passionate about.  Then post a video with a direct appeal to your network about your situation and what you are looking for.  A good rule to follow is to give first, ask later. 

#### Execute With What You Have
Use what you have available.  Professional cameras, lights, and sophisticated editing software is not needed.  However, there are some things to keep in mind when making your videos.  Audio quality is more important than your video quality.  It is important that viewers can hear what you have to share.  Speak loudly and confidently and try to keep background noise to a minimum.  Use your phone, keep it simple and short, three minutes or less.  Begin by doing some test videos to see how it looks and sounds.  You are not perfect and your content does not need to be either.  Once you have something you feel comfortable with sharing, post it on Linkedin.  There a lot of opinions about how often you should post this type of content, but a good rule of thumb is to share when those in your network are more likely to be online.

It may be difficult to create and share video content of yourself at first, but the more you do it the easier it will be.  It is difficult to see someone’s presentation skills, verbal skills, communication skills in an interview.  Think of this as an opportunity to pepper your prospective employer with relevant content about yourself.  Video is how most information is conveyed and people that view our video will feel like they know you better.  Focus on the value you are sharing, being giving, and being authentic.
