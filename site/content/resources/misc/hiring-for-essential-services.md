 During these times most of us are staying indoors and readying ourselves for our remote-work future.  For many, this is a time of introspection and preparation with the knowledge that your organization will be enduring some difficult economic times.  But for some, this is a time of growth.

According to [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/heres-whos-hiring-right-now-4525187/), this is a boom time for those providing essential services.  If that is you, you are probably running into all kinds of stumbling blocks as you scale your company like you never have before. Hiring at scale is entirely different from hiring for a small group of open positions. In your quest for speed, you can easily end up bringing people who don't quite fit in your company. Poor hires, as you already know, are costly, and poor hiring at this stage of a company can break it.

#### Know Who You Are Hiring
One of the most difficult problems at scale is communication. You have different people who need to know exactly what you are looking for, the job requirements, and how they are supposed to go about hiring them.  It's important, then, to write down the job requirements, description, and responsibilities in a clear and concise manner. It's even more important to ensure everyone who is going to be involved in the hiring process has easy access to that information.  Keeping that information updated as policies change is key.  Your organization should use a [central resource](/) that all who need access to can gain that access from wherever they are working from.

#### Structure
Hiring at scale requires a solid hiring process, if you have this you and your team of recruiters can source, interview, and onboard candidates as quickly as possible.  One of the easiest things to improve upon is your interview process. Often, with companies growing fast, the interview process isn't structured and repeatable. It's different for everyone. That is a waste of time and it doesn't get you the results you need. **Divide your job pipeline into stages in a way that each stage gives you some additional information and clarity about the candidate.** For example, you could have a  process that consists of a screening step, then a phone interview, then a couple of interviews on Zoom with your team. At every stage, you get to know a little more about the candidate and their capabilities.

Every job category may have a different hiring process but you must make sure that the same individual applying for—or hiring for—a job doesn't go through several different processes. Consistency and repeatability are the keys to scaling your hiring.  In this way, you also create trust with your candidates and that goes a long way in putting your employee value proposition above another organization’s offer.

#### Automate
Every hiring process has a lot of grunt work that could easily be automated. Think about the thank you e-mails you send to candidates, the interview schedule requests, the review requests to your interviewers... all those are steps that are better automated.

More advanced [hiring software](/) will allow to you create workflows that can automate parts of your hiring. Adopting such a software when you're hiring at scale is a good idea.  It's important, however, to not take automation to its extremes. It's generally a bad idea to reject applications based on certain triggers. Unless you absolutely cannot work without a certain credential or a certain requirement, it is better to screen people manually even if it takes a bit more time.

#### Data Helps Growth, Track Everything
As you grow, it's all the more important to look for inefficient parts of your hiring workflows. What sources aren't working? Which job boards give you the best candidates? Which recruiters deliver the most skilled people? Being able to answer these questions will help you scale better.  Yet again, this is an area that you can automate through software. You don't need to manage huge excel sheets containing every last bit of data. That's not only inefficient but also unnecessary. [Modern applicant tracking systems](/) can help you track every important piece of data and give you insights that help you improve your hiring.

#### Onboarding
At scale, even onboarding new team members can be difficult. By the time they have spent a week on the job, there are ten new faces. Their first day can be daunting too. Your team may be doing all onboarding remotely, what works and what doesn’t?  Define and refine, this is another area where a strong hiring process can help. It's not too difficult, even for a fast-growing company, to take a few minutes to welcome a new team member. At the very least, the team that the person is joining should know about him. The first week goes a long way in helping a new team member feel a part of your organization.

The hiring process and tools you have used in the past will not work in this new and uncharted time we are currently experiencing.  Hiring for essential services is important, the work you are doing is important.  Take the time now to refine your hiring process and the tools you use so you can adapt and find success in this time of change.
