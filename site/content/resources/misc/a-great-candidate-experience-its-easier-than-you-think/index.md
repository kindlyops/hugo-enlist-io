As mentioned before [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-interviews-phone-calls-later-myles-cordova/) and [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/candidate-feedback-when-last-time-you-asked-myles-cordova/) the quality of the candidate experience reflects on you and your organization.  How you treat candidates now, will shape your reputation and how your opportunities will be viewed by the high-quality talent you will need in the future.  The problems are many and it is up to you to fix however, the solutions are easier to implement than you may think.  The easy solution to a great candidate experience does not necessarily mean tearing down your organization’s hiring process and implementing small changes can have a huge impact.

#### Filter and Refine Your Current Hiring Process
Take a look at your current hiring process and honestly ask yourself, where is the disconnect between your organization and the candidate experience?  Where is the gap that needs to be filled?  If you are honestly not sure, start by reaching out to the candidate about their experience.  You do not have to reach out to all of those interviewed, even if you talk to only two or three people you will most likely get some of the same answers.  Incorporate those answers into solutions that build on and refine your hiring process.  Implementation in larger organizations is incremental and is best done by building on what you have.  Typically the area where you will see the most need for refinement in your hiring process is with communication or lack thereof.

#### Automation Can Provide Communication
Communication between the candidate and your organization can involve a lot of people depending on the job opportunity and the size of your company.  Inherently there are a lot of opportunities to drop the ball when it comes to communicating information to the candidate, the hiring manager, and anyone else involved in the hiring process.  Tightening up those gaps can seem daunting but automation can help.  Automation has been a buzz word in almost every industry but seldom is it used in a really valuable way in a hiring process.  Posting jobs and reading resumes aren’t the only things a [quality applicant tracking system](/) should be able to do.  Communication is vital to great candidate experience and by automating resume submission emails, interview reminders for the candidate AND internal employees involved in interviewing, and even feedback surveys post-interview are all examples of straightforward and valuable automation that can easily be implemented in your hiring process.  This is communication and it can help to refine the hiring process so the reputation of you and your organization will be one known for treating candidates with the dignity and respect they deserve.

#### Good Tools Are Easy To Use
Implementing valuable automation and refining your existing hiring infrastructure in your organization will only be easy if you have a good applicant tracking system to implement these changes.  A tool that is easy to use and that can be adopted by all those in your organization who are a part of the hiring process is important.  On that note, you may want to start looking at what kind of tool your organization is currently using and review its functionality.  Is it helping or hindering you in delivering a great candidate experience?  Does it have automation functions, is it easy to sign up and start using right away?  Is there support provided that is beyond just reading help articles?  All these are great points to consider and will be discussed in the next series.
