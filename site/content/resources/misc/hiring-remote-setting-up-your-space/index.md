Experienced hiring managers and recruiters that have a job opportunity to fill are having a difficult time right now.  In a world where the majority of your hiring experience comes from interviewing a candidate in person, hiring someone remotely can be a huge challenge.  Add to that the process of adaptation you may still be doing in order to work from home and be productive in a different environment, interviewing over a video call can seem like the last thing that will help you fill the role you need to be filled.  But hiring remote is now, it's no longer an option and interviewing candidates over video is a part of a solid hiring process.  Getting comfortable with the challenges that come up, should be your goal.  This series will go in-depth on how you can meet those challenges and help your candidate have an amazing experience hiring with you and your organization.

#### Set Up Your Interviewing Space
Before you even begin to sign on to engage in interviewing someone remotely, set up an interviewing space.  Just like you would with a physical office, keep up a high standard in your work from home space.  You would never leave spilled coffee or multiple water bottles strewn about all over your desk in your office at a traditional working space.  Why have the equivalent when you are interviewing someone remotely?  Take a look at your video feed and clear out all the clutter that can be seen behind you well before your interview is scheduled to begin.  Make sure your light is adequate so your candidate can see your facial expressions and sense the tone of your interview.  Log on to your organization’s video conference software and make sure your microphone is picking up your voice in a way that can easily be heard.  This can be done in audio settings and most of the standard software used by most organizations has the functionality to test this in advance of your scheduled interview.  To be effective at interviewing candidates remotely you need to remember that you are giving the candidate a glimpse into your professionalism, and your organization’s culture.  The candidate is assessing you just as much as you are assessing them.  Set up your interviewing space to avoid distractions that can reflect poorly on your job opportunity.

#### Communicate Expectations
Presenting yourself professionally in a video interview is important but communication is one of the biggest ways you can make sure your candidate experience is a positive one.  While this process may be new for you, keep in mind that it is new for your candidate too.  However, this is not an excuse for a poor experience.  Communicate the expectations you have with your candidate.  Be on time for the interview and make sure your software is working properly BEFORE the interview is scheduled to begin.  Let your candidate know in advance what software you are going to use for the interview so they can familiarize themselves with it.  Give them a brief rundown of your organization’s hiring process.  This will allow them to feel more comfortable because they know what will happen next.  That knowledge can do much to help put your candidate at ease and help them to communicate with you more effectively.  By communicating your expectations you are giving your candidate the respect and dignity they deserve and providing an excellent candidate experience despite the inherent challenge of interviewing remotely.
When approaching this issue internally as a hiring manager or people ops leader it is important to not minimize this experience by viewing it as a short term solution.  This will be the new standard, and organizations that adapt to that new standard will find quality candidates and those candidates will have experienced a hiring process that puts your job opportunity above competing offers.  So begin by setting up your interviewing space, make sure you can clearly be seen and heard over video conferences.  Communicate your expectations for your candidate and let them know what will happen next so they are put at ease and feel comfortable communicating with you in this new context.
